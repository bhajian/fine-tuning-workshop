I am running the Houston Marathon for the Leukemia Society. I made a fundraising commitment of $2000. I have raised $1000 and have been waiting for the Enron match of $1000 from the matching gifts program. The request was submitted well in advance of the cutoff deadline that was announced via e-mail a few weeks before the layoffs. The Leukemia Society has not yet received the match. If Enron does not come up with the match, I am personally on the hook for this $1000, and in light of the small severance situation, it is going to be really tough for me right now. Do you have any information on whether or not the Enron commitment will be honored as was communicated in the e-mail? Do you have any idea when the funds will be sent to the Leukemia Society?

With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours. 2. With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section (b), I believe that both parties need to make such reps. The rep in Part 5 (b)(g)(ii) is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep below it. 3. With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different from the setoff language. What this is saying is that if a party has fulfilled all of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to it (the \"Defaulting Party\"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that it owes to the Defaulting Party. This is different from the exercise of setoff rights. 4. I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the removal of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration apply. 5. We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US Dollars. 6. Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i), (ii). Why do you want to delete it?

What this is saying is that if a party has fulfilled all of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to it (the \"Defaulting Party\"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that it owes to the Defaulting Party. This is different from the exercise of setoff rights. 4. I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the removal of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration apply. 5. We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US Dollars. 6. Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i), (ii). Why do you want to delete it? I look forward to hearing from you. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) E-Mail Carol.St.Clair@enron.com\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

{"subject": "Re: Fw: Money in Politics Alert -- July 17, 2001", "body": "Dear John: You're opening my flood gates, and I'm going to refrain from getting entirely upset. Please read the attached letter, which is the one that we sent to Dunn last week. To wit: according to the ISO's own calculations, Enron represents FOUR TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT--that's four-tenths of one percent---of the alleged \"overcharges.\" John, combined, the government sellers, including CA munis have, by the ISOs own calculations, \"overcharged\" California by a factor of ONE HUNDRED times what Enron has alleged to have \"overcharged.\" (See letter from Winters to Burton and Ose.) So notes like this, are ill-informed. I'm looking forward to Mr. Marcus and others directing their invective at SMUD, Glendale, Pasadena, Burbank and LADWP. Nettie Hoge is now being quoted as saying, \"well, it's not the gouging. that's not the problem. it's the \"profit motive\" we've set up that's the problem.\" so munis are victims of a disease (profits) they can't control. everyone else is blood-sucking scum. (in addition, please inform Bill that Sempra's contract with DWR is a drop in the bucket compared to others. it's easy and perhaps even good politics to go after Sempra, but getting Sempra ain't going to come within a light year of solving our DWR contract problem.)

{"subject": "California Assembly Releases \"Modified MOU\" for Edison", "body": "Please forward to others who need this information. As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor. Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group. The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not yet been completed. The URL for the bill is attached. Based on a meeting attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is attached) are: Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on the effective date of the bill) Transmission sale at 2X book. Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by customers 20KW and above. Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits, investigations, etc.) The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts and what the payment structure will look like. Reaction and Timetable Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong possibility. Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed Republicans are strongly opposed Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access. Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts. AB82XX does not address this issue. Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a \"modified MOU.\" Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their \"modified\" MOU this weekend or early next week. The Assembly will hold an \"informational\" hearing on the bill tomorrow (Saturday) to get members up to speed The Assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on Monday, with the intent of sending the bill to the full Assembly for a vote on Tuesday. The Legsilature is supposed to have a month-long recess beginning Friday, July 20th, which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get resolved by then, or suspend the recess and continue working Will continue to provide updates as events unfold. If folks have additional comments on the bill, please direct them to Harry Kingerski and Leslie Lawner, who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in Sacramento.

Provided below are some items I would have mentioned in the Monday staff meeting: Plains Farmer's Coop - To date, I have been able to collect approximately half of the $500,000 imbalance which Plains Coop owes TW. I will be meeting Charles Hough in Friona (Friona is located 100 miles west of Amarillo) on Monday to discuss the payment plan for the remaining imbalance amount in additionaI to other general business matters. I discussed my action plan with legal and credit and will request full payment by January 31, 2000, latest date. Effective Febrary 1st, TW will also include penalty payments with any future imbalance outside the +/- 10% tolerance level. Pogo Producing - I met recently with John Havard with Pogo. Pogo plans to spud a well in Eddy county which is an offset to the EOG operated well recently completed and in the process of being attached to TW. Pogo's well will be spud in December with an expected 60 day drill & completion time. They have an optimistic expectation of the production being close to the EOG well - current initial production of 14 MMcf/d, and have plans for additional drilling in the field area. CIG - A conference call was held with CIG on Friday to discuss delivery performance issues of deliveries to the CIG/Tumbleweed point and the ability of them to increase their delivery capacity to Transwestern. They explained that CIG is currently fully subscribed and operating at MAOP along the line which provides deliveries to Transwestern, El Paso, NNG and SPS/Nichols. All shippers holding capacity along this line (capacity 200 MMcf/d) already have subscribed to long term contracts primarily to El Paso and SPS. Currently they have no operational capability to provide any more incremental delivery capabilities to TW at Tumbleweed. However, they have indicated a probable second Raton Expansion project will be announced March 2001 and have suggested that looping of this southern line could be a possible outcome of the project which would provide incremental delivery capacity to Transwestern above the current 40 MMcf/d level. I will be having additional discussions with CIG marketing individuals to determine who, besides El Paso and Evergreen, are the primary existing shippers down the southern portion of CIG's system in order to potentially get them to realign their contract to Transwestern as a primary delivery point. Expedition of Contracting Process - Per Kevin's request, I provided him, and also discussed, several ideas which would streamline and improve the existing contract processing cycle. The most important and critical recommendation was to revise the 3 year old ET&S Discounting Policy which Bill Cordes had established for both TW and Northern. Obtaining approval of even a few simple changes I could recommend to the Policy (applicable only to Transwestern, not NNG) would have an immediate effect of simplying the Officer approval process and would expedite the turn-around time.", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

{"subject": "EPA Mercury Determination", "body": "EPA's Mercury determination was released today. It can be accessed at www.epa.gov/mercury It will likely take some time for EPA to develop these regulations -- the time frame is proposed rule by 2003 and final rule by 2004 -- but this is a significant step in that it now formally puts mercury on the radar screen for power generators, in terms of planning for emissions controls. It is a positive step that EPA included in its determination an intent to develop \"flexible\" compliance measures -- i.e. trading -- for mercury. It also means that mercury will most likely be included in any efforts to develop \"multi-pollutant\" legislation in the next Congress. Please call me if you have any questions. _________________ THURSDAY, DEC. 14, 2000 EPA DECIDES MERCURY EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS MUST BE REDUCED To protect public health and the environment, EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner today announced that the Clinton Administration will require reductions, for the first time ever, of harmful mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants -- the largest source of such emissions in America. After extensive study, EPA determined mercury emissions from power plants pose significant hazards to public health and must be reduced. The agency will propose regulations by 2003 and issue final rules by 2004. \"Mercury from power plants settles over waterways, polluting rivers and lakes, and contaminating fish. Exposure to mercury poses real risks to public health, especially to children and developing fetuses,\" Browner said. \"The greatest source of mercury emissions is power plants, and they have never been required to control these emissions before now. Today's decision to address this problem marks a major step forward in the Clinton Administration's ongoing efforts to protect public health and the environment.\" Exposure to mercury has been associated with both neurological and developmental damage in humans. The developing fetus is the most sensitive to mercury's effects, which include damage to nervous system development. People are exposed to mercury primarily through eating fish that have been contaminated when mercury from power plants and other sources is deposited to water bodies. Once mercury enters water, biological processes can transform it into methylmercury, a highly toxic form of mercury that builds up in animal and human tissues. EPA recommends that subsistence fisherman, pregnant women, and others should always heed state fishing advisories. Under the Clean Air Act, EPA is required to study toxic air pollution from power plants in order to determine if additional regulations are necessary in order to protect public health. EPA reported its study to Congress in February 1998. That study concluded that of all toxic pollution examined, mercury posed the greatest concern to public health. An earlier study concluded that the largest source of human-made mercury pollution in America was coal-fired power plants. After completion of the study, the Clean Air Act required EPA to determine whether to proceed with the development of regulations. Today, EPA is announcing that it has affirmatively decided that mercury air emissions from power plants should be regulated, because mercury poses the greatest hazards to public health. EPA will propose regulations by December 2003 and will begin developing those regulations shortly. Industry, the public, and state, local and tribal governments will have an opportunity to participate in the process. Then, EPA will issue final regulations by December 2004. The Clinton Administration already has taken a number of aggressive actions to reduce mercury air pollution, including significantly reducing allowable emissions from municipal waste combustors, medical waste incinerators and hazardous waste combustors. When fully implemented in 2005, the existing rules will reduce total human-caused mercury emissions by nearly 50 percent from 1990 levels nationwide.

Exposure to mercury poses real risks to public health, especially to children and developing fetuses,\" Browner said. \"The greatest source of mercury emissions is power plants, and they have never been required to control these emissions before now. Today's decision to address this problem marks a major step forward in the Clinton Administration's ongoing efforts to protect public health and the environment.\" Exposure to mercury has been associated with both neurological and developmental damage in humans. The developing fetus is the most sensitive to mercury's effects, which include damage to nervous system development. People are exposed to mercury primarily through eating fish that have been contaminated when mercury from power plants and other sources is deposited to water bodies. Once mercury enters water, biological processes can transform it into methylmercury, a highly toxic form of mercury that builds up in animal and human tissues. EPA recommends that subsistence fisherman, pregnant women, and others should always heed state fishing advisories. Under the Clean Air Act, EPA is required to study toxic air pollution from power plants in order to determine if additional regulations are necessary in order to protect public health. EPA reported its study to Congress in February 1998. That study concluded that of all toxic pollution examined, mercury posed the greatest concern to public health. An earlier study concluded that the largest source of human-made mercury pollution in America was coal-fired power plants. After completion of the study, the Clean Air Act required EPA to determine whether to proceed with the development of regulations. Today, EPA is announcing that it has affirmatively decided that mercury air emissions from power plants should be regulated, because mercury poses the greatest hazards to public health. EPA will propose regulations by December 2003 and will begin developing those regulations shortly. Industry, the public, and state, local and tribal governments will have an opportunity to participate in the process. Then, EPA will issue final regulations by December 2004. The Clinton Administration already has taken a number of aggressive actions to reduce mercury air pollution, including significantly reducing allowable emissions from municipal waste combustors, medical waste incinerators and hazardous waste combustors. When fully implemented in 2005, the existing rules will reduce total human-caused mercury emissions by nearly 50 percent from 1990 levels nationwide.

To: Doug Leach@ECT cc: Dan J Hyvl@ECT, Ermes Melinchon/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Amendment to Fuel Supply Doug: Following our conversation of last week, attached is the draft of the amendment to the fuel supply for your review and approval. As you may recall, this document became necessary after we became aware of the letter agreement dated August 12, 1996. If you have any questions, please give me a call, otherwise please let me know you are okay with it so that I can send it to the lenders for their review and approval. many thanks FPL\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

You continue to make it happen. We recognize that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron\u0001,s business goals, and we are pleased that many of you have shared in the company\u0001,s financial success through Enron stock options. As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as the All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided value to participants through 2000. Employees who have participated in this program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the program. Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron\u0001,s continued success. Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decided to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package. On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions \u0001) Your Stock Option Program).

The new program, which is subject to final approval by Enron\u0001,s Board of Directors, is as follows: ? EnronOptions \u0001) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and international companies/locations. ?

Find out more at: http://www.consultrci.com ************************************************************************ =============================================================== SCIENTECH IssueAlert, December 12, 2000 Powergen and LG&E Complete Merger By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis =============================================================== Powergen of the United Kingdom and LG&E Energy Corp. of Louisville, Ky., have completed their merger and have formally begun joint operations. LG&E will maintain its headquarters in Louisville, which will serve as the headquarters for Powergen's North American operations. LG&E Energy's utility subsidiaries, Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities Company, will continue as separate subsidiary corporations with joint operations and with headquarters in Louisville and Lexington, Ky., respectively. ANALYSIS: Although referred to as a \"merger,\" Powergen actually has acquired LG&E, a strong utility based in the Midwest that remains focused on all three core sectors of the electric utility business (generation, transmission and distribution). Powergen, which generates about 14 percent of the electricity used in England and Wales, is a company with clear intentions to expand internationally. The company currently has electric and gas operations in Europe, India, Asia and Australia. Together, the Powergen / LG&E combination reportedly will have assets of nearly $14 billion and total revenues of $9 billion, serving four million customers worldwide. The partnership marks the third acquisition of a U.S. electric utility by a foreign company, following ScottishPower's purchase of PacifiCorp and National Grid's purchase of the New England Electric System (NEES), both in 1999. It appears that with each subsequent foreign acquisition of a U.S. utility, the regulatory hurdles needed to complete the deal have become easier to pass. Powergen's reasons for wanting to acquire assets in the United States arise from needs similar to its U.K. counterparts. In the last ten years that have elapsed since the privatization and subsequent deregulation of electricity in the United Kingdom, the electric sector has become completely competitive in all areas, including domestic customers. Just as in U.S. deregulation, concerns about market power have restricted the domestic growth of U.K. companies, which is compounded by the limited size of the U.K. energy market. Consequently, companies like Powergen have developed unique skills both in the United Kingdom and overseas so that they can expand scale through opportunities abroad. Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the U.S. market and evaluated potential partnerships with several energy companies in this country, including Cinergy and Houston Industries (now Reliant), which all fizzled. LG&E is particularly appealing to Powergen because of the U.K. company's desire to establish a strong presence in the Midwest market. LG&E should be a good partner for Powergen, as the latter gains access to approximately 3.7 million customers. In addition, LG&E owns equity in and operates non-utility power plants in six states as well as in Spain; owns interest in three natural-gas distribution companies in Argentina; and owns CRC-Evans Pipeline International, a provider of specialty equipment to the natural-gas and oil pipeline construction industry. Altogether, LG&E's two utilities and numerous unregulated businesses total about $5 billion in assets, which should ", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

Luckily we have the non-DNRC people, the so-called In-duh-viduals, to do our manual labor. After Dogbert conquers the planet and makes the Induhviduals our personal servants, there will be no more fussing with parallel parking. A small team of Induhviduals will be stationed at every potential parking place, ready to lift your vehicle and gently place it near the curb. A second team will swoop in and tongue-clean your bumper to remove the fingerprints left by the first team. A third team will swoop in and take your vehicle to the landfill so you don't have to drive a car that's been slobbered on. I realize this sounds inefficient, but remember there are over six billion Induhviduals. It's important to keep them busy. Speaking of keeping busy... My Trip to New York City --------------------------------- I am writing this trip report while in New York City to do some PR for my new web site feature (The Lazy Entrepreneur at Dilbert.com). Because I am a famous cartoonist I am staying in a new hotel that costs $500 per night. That might impress those of you who live in huts made entirely of manure. But if you are familiar with NYC you are probably blowing coffee out your nose and slapping your donut flat in a fit of spastic laughter because you know what $500 buys in the Big Apple. Herein, I offer my description of the luxurious NYC hotel experience. I'm struck by the similarity between my situation and John Gotti's. We have similar careers: He's a convicted mob boss; I'm a cartoonist. But here the similarity ends, because his current living conditions are far more luxurious. My room is ever-so-slightly wider than the bed. If it were possible to make a room smaller than its bed, I would be in that room. I'm sure the hotel has hired a team of physicists to crack that nut. The television's remote control doesn't work, but that doesn't matter because you can reach the TV with your hand from almost any location in the room. The \"closet\" consists of a ten-inch metal pipe that sticks out from the wall, suitable for hanging upwards of three garments. Directly below the metal pipe is a safe for your valuables. This leaves plenty of space for your clothes, assuming you wear the same pants size as G.I. Joe. My heating/cooling system produces an inexplicable noise every five minutes. The noise sounds like a combination of a squeaky door opening and a sword being drawn from its scabbard. This is exactly the sort of noise you want to hear when you're trying to sleep in New York City. The shower has a playful feature. The only way you can get to the shower controls is by reaching around a barrier and placing your head directly under the showerhead. There's nothing like a snoot full of cold water to get your day started. As you probably know, New York City taxi drivers originate from many different countries. They compensate for their incomplete grasp of English by facing away from the passenger and mumbling. I learned to interpret their mumbles by the context. For example, a mumble when you get in the car means, \"You look handsome today. To what destination may I transport you?\" A mumble while slowing down and looking out a side window means, \"This is your destination. Have a wonderful day.

{"subject": "RE: Alberta PPA Financing", "body": "Mark, further to our converstaion this morning, I attach the latest version of the swap financing structure with RBC DS. The idea is to have the swaps prepay a funded amount which is then repaid through the swap structure over the term of the transactions (1 year). Please note that rather than determining the one year PV value of the funded amount and interest at time = 0 relative to a fixed price, with monthly settlements then occuring in the normal course based on market movements, I understand that it is neceassary to have interest payments settled monthly with a bullet principal repayment by settlement at the end of the one year term. Some explanatory notes: 1. Bill Bradford's group is putting the credit terms together. Once that occurs we will need to have drafts to RBC DS ASAP. 2. Enron Canada Corp.'s obligations will be guaranteed by Enron Corp. to the extent outlined in the credit worksheet. 3. It is fundamental to the structure for Global Finance that there not be any net collateral exposure. In other words, collateral thresholds must offset or mirror each other such that if, for exapmle, Enron Canada is required to provide $50MM of margin to RBC DS, Financing SPV will also have to provide $50MM of margin to Enron Canada Corp., notwithstanding that Enron Canada Corp. ought really not be exposed unless there is a market movement having an exposure value in excess of the funded amount of $300MM. (NOTE: The actual amount required to complete the purchase of the PPA is C$235,840,000, the first installment of C$58,960,000 having already been funded by an intercompany loan from Enron Canada Corp. to Enron Canada Power Corp.) 4. In terms of documentation, the swaps should be documented under ISDA Masters. I understand that there may be an ISDA Master in place between Royal Bank of Camada and Enron North America Corp. and also one in place also with Enron Corp. (this will need to be confirmed). As the transactions need to be at the Enron Canada Corp. level, however, I suggest that ISDA Masters need to be prepared between Enron Canada Corp. and RBC DS and between Enron Canada Corp. and Financing SPV on the same terms as the current ISDA Master between Enron North America Corp. (or Enron Corp.) and Royal Bank of Canada, subject to the credit terms provided by Credit. The individual transactions themselves would then be documentd on transaction Confirmation Letters. I am not fussed as to who prepares the paper and it might be easiest for your group to do so. Please also note that external legal opinions may be required in respect of Enron Canada Corp. and Enron Corp. Blakes is prepared to provide legal opinions for Enron Canada Corp. and whatever advice or support is necessary. 5. Once the funding occurs to Enron Canada Corp., it will be advanced by intercompany loan to Enron Canada Power Corp. to acquire the PPA, and I will look after this aspect of the transaction. 6. Please note that Enron Canada Power Corp. must put the Government in funds on Friday Spetember 22nd. ---------------------- Forwarded by Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT on 09/13/2000 09:12 AM --------------------------- Soma Ghosh 09/12/2000 05:41 PM To: Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT, Andre Templeman/CAL/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: RE: Alberta PPA ---------------------- Forwarded by Soma Ghosh/HOU/ECT on 09/12/2000 06:40 PM --------------------------- Soma Ghosh 09/12/2000 10:06 PM To: Cris Sherman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: RE: Alberta PPA Chris, As promised, I am forwarding details of 'SwapCo'.

Some explanatory notes: 1. Bill Bradford's group is putting the credit terms together. Once that occurs we will need to have drafts to RBC DS ASAP. 2. Enron Canada Corp.'s obligations will be guaranteed by Enron Corp. to the extent outlined in the credit worksheet. 3. It is fundamental to the structure for Global Finance that there not be any net collateral exposure. In other words, collateral thresholds must offset or mirror each other such that if, for exapmle, Enron Canada is required to provide $50MM of margin to RBC DS, Financing SPV will also have to provide $50MM of margin to Enron Canada Corp., notwithstanding that Enron Canada Corp. ought really not be exposed unless there is a market movement having an exposure value in excess of the funded amount of $300MM. (NOTE: The actual amount required to complete the purchase of the PPA is C$235,840,000, the first installment of C$58,960,000 having already been funded by an intercompany loan from Enron Canada Corp. to Enron Canada Power Corp.) 4. In terms of documentation, the swaps should be documented under ISDA Masters. I understand that there may be an ISDA Master in place between Royal Bank of Camada and Enron North America Corp. and also one in place also with Enron Corp. (this will need to be confirmed). As the transactions need to be at the Enron Canada Corp. level, however, I suggest that ISDA Masters need to be prepared between Enron Canada Corp. and RBC DS and between Enron Canada Corp. and Financing SPV on the same terms as the current ISDA Master between Enron North America Corp. (or Enron Corp.) and Royal Bank of Canada, subject to the credit terms provided by Credit. The individual transactions themselves would then be documentd on transaction Confirmation Letters. I am not fussed as to who prepares the paper and it might be easiest for your group to do so. Please also note that external legal opinions may be required in respect of Enron Canada Corp. and Enron Corp. Blakes is prepared to provide legal opinions for Enron Canada Corp. and whatever advice or support is necessary. 5. Once the funding occurs to Enron Canada Corp., it will be advanced by intercompany loan to Enron Canada Power Corp. to acquire the PPA, and I will look after this aspect of the transaction. 6. Please note that Enron Canada Power Corp. must put the Government in funds on Friday Spetember 22nd. ---------------------- Forwarded by Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT on 09/13/2000 09:12 AM --------------------------- Soma Ghosh 09/12/2000 05:41 PM To: Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT, Andre Templeman/CAL/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: RE: Alberta PPA ---------------------- Forwarded by Soma Ghosh/HOU/ECT on 09/12/2000 06:40 PM --------------------------- Soma Ghosh 09/12/2000 10:06 PM To: Cris Sherman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: RE: Alberta PPA Chris, As promised, I am forwarding details of 'SwapCo'.

The time that you have set aside for fasting sounds great. Rev. Jacque mentioned in the last meeting that we would discuss a time for all so that we could be on one accord.

All rights reserved. California is fast becoming the symbol for problems that can develop when the electric utility industry is deregulated. Since becoming the first state to deregulate its retail market, California has had several power shortages this summer in which consumers were hit with skyrocketing electric rates. In San Diego, rates doubled and even quadrupled in the last two months. There's so much public backlash that members of Congress from California will hold hearings this month to examine the problem. Trade groups that represent the utility companies and public power organizations say deregulation is not at fault, but rather the specific way in which California opened its markets without accounting for supply and demand. They say there's not enough power generation to meet demand. The state hasn't built any power plants for at least 10 years, in large part because of the resistance utilities face from environmentalists concerned about siting locations. The National Energy Marketers Association, which represents wholesale and retail energy marketers, warned that suggestions about placing price caps for wholesale power markets would backfire. Instead, the group says Congress and states should eliminate regulations that harm competition in wholesale and retail power markets. The group says the problem has been exacerbated by policies that increase the risk to build new power plants and a lack of uniformity for operating procedures and other requirements. California's utility problems have also become an issue in the presidential campaign. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader has called on the state legislature and Gov. Gray Davis to pass a rate rollback law that doesn't include a balloon payment to compensate utilities for the money they would lose during a rate decrease. \"Electricity deregulation really brings about a collision of interests,\" Nader said. \"It pits the interests of consumers - who are often unorganized and lack power against the interests of supplierswho are usually very organized, powerful and have a lot of money behind them. It shouldn't be that way.\" Energy Issues Divide Bush, Gore For the first time in 20 years, energy issues could emerge as a major issue in the presidential campaign. Both major candidates are trying to use the issue to their advantage. The Democrats argue that Texas Gov. George W. Bush and running mate Dick Cheney - who are well-known figures in the oil industry - are in the back pockets of oil companies that have lobbied to drill on more public lands. Republicans have criticized Vice President Gore for failing to develop a plan to address the country's long-term energy needs. The Republicans say that Gore and his running mate Joseph Lieberman are more concerned about winning the support of environmentalists than they are in developing an energy policy. Gore and Lieberman support the development of alternative energy sources and tax credits for energy-efficient vehicles. They also have promised to block energy companies from drilling for oil or natural gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska or along the coasts of California and Florida. Bush and Cheney favor increased domestic oil production to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Bush says he backs the moratorium on new drilling in Florida and California, but supports oil exploration in the Arctic refuge. Both Gore and Bush support new federal regulations that would require lower sulfur levels in gasoline and cleaner engines in cars.

Reply with only the label.\n### Email:\nSubject: Re: crestar / gulf aos contract....\nBody: Grant, The problem is that they do not want to assign the agreement. They want to do a partial assignment which is unacceptable unless we can severe the document so that we have two separate stand alone pieces of paper after the assignment. Talk to them about doing two Spot Confirmations, one for 0 to 8,400 MMBtu per day which would not be assignable, and the other one for 0 to 11,600 MMBtu per day which would be assignable to BP. Call me so that we can discuss. Grant Oh 03/19/2001 05:16 PM To: Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: crestar / gulf aos contract....

Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees. Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance. HOW TO ENROLL: 1. Print out the attached registration form. 2. Complete the form, but please note the following SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS: A. Fill out the student information completely, including your email address. B. In the Enrollment section, where it says \"Please enroll me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________\", C. In the Payment section: For the course at Enron, the tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.

The Texas MBA Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.

Lindsey, et al: Attached is PG&E's revised OFO Settlement Agreement based on our discussion and agreements at yesterday's Settlement Conference. Before getting into the details, I want to thank Lindsey and the other active parties for their diligence and willingness to negotiate constructively in order to reach consensus. The following highlights the changes, which are shown as revision-marks against our September 24 proposal. We've added a couple of \"clean-up\" changes not specifically addressed yesterday. I don't believe these should cause any problem. * \"Significantly\" is added under A. and B.1. * In section B.1, we have inserted the term \"Gas OFO Forum\" so when we talk about this forum outside the settlement, it has a specific name we all recognize and agree to. We have made changes elsewhere in the document to include this more formal title. We also included \"or customer\" as being able to join the Forum. * In B.2, we used the words provided yesterday by the parties with two exceptions: * First, the language was revised to make a six-month comparison of OFO reductions, rather than a quarterly comparison as we agreed, and * Second, we added the word \"other\" to modify \"members\" in two places so it is clear that PG&E is also a member of the Forum. * In B.3, we changed the term \"Settlement Parties\" to \"Gas OFO Forum\" to reflect the intent of the agreement. * In B.4, we added the sentence at the end as requested, but, per our discussion, did not remove our last sentence. We added more specific language on the balancing account to be clearer, and noted that this issue is not fully resolved pending feedback from a couple parties. * In C.1.g, we used the language provided, removing the one sentence as agreed, and we added a comma and an \"a\" in the last sentence. * We did not include the proposed change from the parties for C.1.f.(3) for more data, since per yesterday's discussion we already agreed to provide that data elsewhere. * In C.3.b.(7), we modified the language to reflect our discussion that we would use a 100% Performance Factor for the first customer-specific OFO, and then an average of the actual performance for subsequent customer-specific OFOs, but not less than 50%. We also agree to post the performance data and revised factor within 14 days of each customer-specific OFO, and if another customer-specific OFO is needed in that period, to use the prior factor. We also changed \"Settlement Parties\" to the \"Gas OFO Forum.\" Lastly, we changed the \"next session\" to \"an ongoing basis\" which better fits the continuous nature of the data and adjustments. * In C.4.a, although not discussed the group at the Settlement Conference, Ron Oechsler, on behalf of Palo Alto, pointed out that our description of the three days when cashouts were driven by market economics was not quite correct. We have reviewed his comment and concur, and have corrected the wording accordingly. This does not change this provision to modify the cash-out prices. * In C.5.e.(4), we added the monthly election option. * In D.3.c, we added the suggested language, but changed \"Settlement Parties\" to the \"Gas OFO Forum.\" * On Appendix A, Revised Tariffs, we added the new balancing account which would be part of the Preliminary Statement in PG&E's gas tariffs.

Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities, standard swaps, options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment flows should not be subject to withholding tax. However, to the extent that Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments, concern exists that imputed interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding tax. 2. Consumption Tax (VAT) and Excise Taxes Although Japan imposes a 5% consumption tax (VAT), financial transactions are generally not subject to the consumption tax, so cash settled derivative transactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax. Japan imposes various kinds of excise taxes. These excise taxes generally apply to physical importation and domestic sale and delivery of covered products and should generally not apply to purely financial derivatives transactions which reference commodity prices. 3. Collateral for Derivatives Transactions If Enron entities will take collateral from Japan-based customers in connection with derivative transactions, depending upon the specific arrangements, withholding tax liability might arise. For example, if an Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japan-based customer and pays interest on it, such interest payments could be subject to local withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer.

A sample can be viewed at: http://www.consultrci.com/web/infostore.nsf/Products/InfoGrid ************************************************************************ =============================================================== SCIENTECH IssueAlert, October 11, 2000 Online Niche Players Capitalize on Natural-Gas Shortage, Bypass Utilities By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis =============================================================== SmartEnergy, a Con Edison competitor, is offering New York and Westchester consumers price protection with the ability to lock-in today's natural-gas rates for a period of one year. In a separate announcement, myHomeKey.com announced that it will offer energy savings packages designed to reduce energy consumption and lower rates for customers in the face of rising energy costs. ANALYSIS: As reports continue to accumulate that a natural-gas shortage will send prices skyrocketing this winter (see my IssueAlert from Oct. 9 on the subject), the most common response from electric utilities has been to warn their customers that they will see higher rates over the next few months. I can point to several examples. Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy announced a few weeks back that its natural-gas customers could face heating bills that are 35 to 50 percent higher than their bills last winter. Dominion East Ohio has warned its residential customers that they can expect to pay about $70 more per month for natural gas from November through January. And the warnings are coming not only in the Midwest and Northeast\u0001*where low winter temperatures drive up energy bills every year\u0001*but in the West as well. In California, PG&E warns that its customers can expect to see their winter bills increase by about $25, to an average bill of $75 (compared to $50 last winter). These are just a few examples of utility companies across the United States playing damage control, trying to minimize the customer outrage when customers suddenly see their bills double or triple. Along with their warnings, these utilities give reasons\u0001*perhaps seen as excuses by the public\u0001*for the rising cost of energy. There is a shortage of natural gas across the country, brought about by a drop-off in production. It was an unusually hot summer, which depleted supplies for energy. Demand in general has grown to surprising levels. Meanwhile, start-up online companies that many of us have not even heard of are using the rise in natural-gas prices as a golden marketing opportunity, and attempting to take business away from traditional utility companies. SmartEnergy is a perfect example. In existence just since April 1999, SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers. According to EnergyGuide.com, for an average home in New York City, SmartEnergy's natural-gas rates typically have run about $189 per month, compared Con Edison's $140. Under its new promotion, SmartEnergy's plan for natural gas guarantees that New York City and Westchester gas customers who sign on with their service now will be locked into current natural-gas rates for the next 12 months. This promotion comes at an ideal time for those who opt to switch, as natural-gas prices should begin their projected sharp increase over the next few weeks. Based on recent forecasts, SmartEnergy is claiming that Con Edison customers who make the switch can expect to save up to 40 percent on their energy through the winter months.

Jim is right--we need to be prepared for anything. Bill- I heard today that PG&E has sent us a letter or otherwise communicated to us that they are looking for a letter from us on valuation and are going to challenge our setoffs.

In particular has Enron completed the process of obtaining quotes so that the amount of the Termination Payments is set. I'm concerned that PG&E would be more likely to hit the LC's once the amounts have been set. We'll be ready to file something if they try that, but I'd like a heads up so that we know the possibility is out there. ============================================================================== This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

The prices are in line with December balance-of-month forward prices in the Mid Columbia River market electricity hub, which hit $525/MWh, and January forward prices, which hit $475/MWh on Monday. Prices in the CalPX, which operates the state's day-of, day-ahead and block forward electricity market, are likely an indication of the prices the Independent System Operator is paying to secure that out-of-state generation, the CalPX source said. The California ISO, which must ensure the state's grid reliability and operates 75% of the state real-time market, declared a stage-one electrical emergency Monday, meaning operating reserves were below 7%. The ISO said 10,000 MW of power was off line, and issued a call to buy 3,000 MW out of state. It is strange that the CalPX would hit an across-the-board cap in the winter, as opposed to the traditional high-peak summer season, market sources said.

The prices are in line with December balance-of-month forward prices in the Mid Columbia River market electricity hub, which hit $525/MWh, and January forward prices, which hit $475/MWh on Monday. Prices in the CalPX, which operates the state's day-of, day-ahead and block forward electricity market, are likely an indication of the prices the Independent System Operator is paying to secure that out-of-state generation, the CalPX source said. The California ISO, which must ensure the state's grid reliability and operates 75% of the state real-time market, declared a stage-one electrical emergency Monday, meaning operating reserves were below 7%. The ISO said 10,000 MW of power was off line, and issued a call to buy 3,000 MW out of state. It is strange that the CalPX would hit an across-the-board cap in the winter, as opposed to the traditional high-peak summer season, market sources said. The ISO has had an unusual winter, however, having declared an unprecedented five stage-two power emergencies in November due to a large amount of generation off line for planned and unplanned maintenace. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswire; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 04-12-00 2052GMT G_nther A.

Yesterday we entered/moved our exotic deal (deal # 13982.3, which was originally in Short-term Southwest book) into the new Short-term west rockies book and we are seeing a couple of problems: (1) It seems that in DprAutomation the Short-term west rockies book was named as \"ST-WROCK\", rather than \"ST-WR\" (i.e. the book's/roll's name in M:\\common\\power\\Postion\\Dpr\\2001\\0102). Therefore, last night and this morning we had to temparily changed the roll's name to ST-WROCK in order to allow DprAutomation to run through the roll to bring in P&L/PCS/PID data. (After DprAutomation was done running, we then changed it back to ST-WR so we can link the roll to the \"pwrdpr\" file). => We need DprAutomation to use \"ST-WR\" for Short-term west rockies book so we won't have to change the file name everytime we run DprAutomation. (2) As mentioned earlier, yeterday deal #13982.3 's desk was changed from ST-SW to Short-term west rockies in the Exotic book. Although we officialize the Exotic book (post id 14061), Nancy Hernandez in Risk Management (Houston) found that they could not see the Short-term west rockies book officialized in Exotic. => I am not sure if this is due to the same problem as in (1) or something else. We need the new Short-term west rockies book set up right so it can be officialized in the Exotic book in order for the Risk Control Group in Houston to see/monitor it. Please help us look at the above issues. Let me know if I can provide more useful information. (For Nancy: I spoke with Valarie and there is nothing we know of other than deal #13982.3 that was in the ST-SW book in Exotic book.

Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the sky. About 70 degrees. 11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself. 12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us). We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas. AWESOME MOMENT. 12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs. Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the \"Traveler\" and 11 cans of beer into my pants. 1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as \"Cell-Phone Flop Out.\" Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should \"flop out\" his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl.

I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I RULE the pre-game kingdom. 2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy. 2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas. 3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas. Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit.

Subject: Information Request Hello everyone. I know that many, if not all of you, have worked on numerous requests/initiatives from the office of the chair and other teams lately. That being said, we received a new request on Thursday night which is another look at some of the information your groups may have already provided, along with some other information. Attached is a file, with the breakouts and formats as requested by management, containing four (for some of you, five) spreadsheets. Please complete all of these sheets applicable to your business unit (note: dollars in millions). The requested timing of the completion of this exercise is by 3pm Friday, November 15. Please send the completed file back to me as soon as you are finished. If you have any questions about the format or the contents of the file, please contact Michelle Nezi Marvin at 3-6848. For any other questions, please call Mark Lindsey at 3-1873. Thanks, Steve\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

{"subject": "BVI", "body": "I've chartered in the BVI a number of times and it is a great place to take beginners. I only caught your post of yesterday so didn't see the earlier thread. I'm assuming you're picking up the boat in Road Town or nearby. The only problem with getting away from the dock by 12 or so is if the boat isn't quite ready. I've always used the Moorings so they're the only outfit I know. They don't usually let you get started on the boat until after the chart briefing which means you don't go aboard until 10. If you use their provisioning service it eases that chore but sometimes the food isn't there right on time. Having several people (but not too many) around this time is helpful to put food away, take inventory, attend boat briefing, etc. Of course, if you get the boat the day before - maybe with a sleepaboard option or some such, you have that much more certainty that everything will be done on time. Check with your charter company about attending the briefings before sending the last person off to the airport - some companies may require 2 people from your boat to attend. As for first day - if you are away by 1 I suggest heading over to the Bight on Norman Island. There are lots of moorings there and you'll get one as long as you're not in too late. It shouldn't take more than a few hours to get there and if it looks like it might be close you can always fire up the engine. There are a couple of places (a beach bar and a boat) to eat and drink there if you don't feel like cooking the first night and although you can't call it deserted or even secluded because of the number of boats there, there is at least very little ashore to bother you. The caves are just around the corner and the Indians right outside for great snorkeling/diving either that afternoon or first thing the next day. Whether you go clockwise or counterclockwise doesn't really matter. My advice running roughly clockwise: skip Soppers Hole - just a commercial port with little of interest (unless you're clearing customs); skip the USVI - all the clearing out & in & out & in can take a lot of time and there's plenty to do in the BVI - if you just have to go, the northern shore of St. John is the best - nice anchorages (several of the 'secluded' variety) without the crime on St. Thomas and the resort at Caneel Bay will let you come ashore for a fancy dinner (but make reservations and leave your trash on board - there's nowhere to put it); Jost van Dyke is fun - anchor in Great Harbor or pick up a mooring in Little Harbor - Sydney's Peace & Love restaurant in Little Harbor still has an honor bar where you mix your own drinks & just keep track in his little black book while you're waiting for dinner, Foxie's in Great Harbor is a classic beach bar/rest. - lots of fun and good food & drinks; Sandy Cay is everyone's image of a desert island and perfect for a lunch stop and a swim; don't miss Cane Garden Bay (unless the northerly swell is too heavy) there's a wonderful swath of pure white beach with palm trees swaying overhead and steel drum bands serenade you into the evening - watch the reefs but the channel in is well marked; if there's a full moon be sure to be on Tortola somewhere that night (Cane Garden works fine) to get to Bomba's Shack for the party - there are lots of taxis there as the evening progresses to get you back; it's easy to pick people up (or drop them off) at the airport (close to the water with a dinghy dock) midweek if you need to and kind of fun to be met that way; the Baths are a must but VERY crowded (no anchoring allowed - must use a mooring) so I'd try to get there as early in the day as possible (Cooper Island, Marina Cay and area by Last Resort are nearby for the night before) - maybe get up early, motor or sail over and have breakfast once you're safely moored - and be careful to use the right color mooring and avoid the ones reserved for commercial craft; I usually skip Spanish Town (Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor) since I'd rather be at anchor th", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

This is, obviously, not the correct counterparty name. Please correct and send confirmations at your earliest convenience. Derek and George - I have Global Counterparty setting up this new entity in our systems. Please ensure that these trades get moved from BP Capital Energy Equity Fund, L.P. to BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1, L.P. THIS IS CRITICAL. Margin calculations are dependent on these trades being booked correctly. While Mike Larsen has been very accomodating, our margin team can not afford to spend time reconciling trades at the present.

Daily Gas Price Index published : August 22, 2001 CA Power Buying Agency Shops for Natural Gas, Too As part of its 53 long-term electricity contracts, California's Department of Water Resources (DWR) is shopping for a portfolio of natural gas supplies of various duration to use in about half the deals that give the state the option of providing its own fuel supplies when it can beat prevailing market rates used by its power suppliers. So far, it has seven gas deals in various stages of development with six different marketers, according to Sacramento-based DWR spokesperson Oscar Hidalgo. Two contracts are in effect now with Pan-Canadian Energy Services for July and August strips of gas supplies. At this point, DWR will not talk about how much gas and/or electric supplies are involved. \"We have a total of seven 'enabling agreements' that allow us to purchase supplies into the future without re-doing the whole contract process each time,\" Hidalgo said. \"What we have now are two executed contracts with Pan-Canadian for gas. \"It doesn't mean we have to supply gas for the generator (in our long-term contracts), it just means if we can buy gas at a better rate, we have an option to do so. So we're in the early stages of building a gas portfolio that will allow us to bring gas to the deal if it is cost-effective for us to do so.\" DWR is looking at possible storage services as part of its gas deals, said Hidalgo, noting that the state's power-buying agency wants to hedge by having some bulk power deals tied to fixed prices and others using gas tolling arrangements. In addition to the Canadian company, the five other gas marketers with which DWR is talking are: BP Energy Co.; Coast Energy Group; Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc.; Dynegy Marketing and Trade; and Texaco Natural Gas, Inc.", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

I believe that Rod may have a pot at the ETS level. We will need to work with Tracy on this. If you have dollars that you will not spend, though, please let us know.

According to John Reese, another $2,010,921 will hit this year. How are these dollars to be funded? I am assuming that we will be adjusting our CE for the Cooper Pre-Buy dollars, but I would like confirmation on how you would like for us to handle.

I am working with the following assumptions: 1. The 120 monthly spreadsheets will be maintained and updated to the EBB every hour between 6:00 am and 6:00 pm. This is consistent with the historical updating since mid 1998, and I will continue to do this until the new CAS process is tested and released for your group to use(Best guess 2 more month-end nom cycles). 2. The new CAS process will update the EBB with the same data as the spreadsheets. We need to determine if we will include all receipt & delivery points, and if we will include a partial group/path list as we currently post. Currently the spreadsheet contains only those points and/or groups that we thought our shippers might be interested in using monthly. 3. The Gas Control Allocation and Facility Planning unsubscribed modules are adopting new standard group names, I will let you review what those will be prior to any changes to production. 4. The ROFR flag is now in the new CAS and will reduce the unsubscribe numbers past the contract expiration date. This will be effective after CAS is released to you. Currently the 120 monthly spreadsheets tract subscribe FT to the contract expiration date, no reservations past the expiration date. Let me know if my assumptions are correct, and any changes that might effect the above efforts. I need to let the IT group start their development process, as to, What we will post from CAS?

The problem: As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: \"if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate,\" and the additional frustrating language \"[a]ll available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . ..\" At our last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate to index prices. However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals. I have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum rate. Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above. However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language. Why the problem exists (you may already know): Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in the first place. In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a cost-of-service based tariff rates. \"[T]he availability of a recourse service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service. Thus, the recourse rate mitigates market power.\" The Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly not limited to ROFR situations: when capacity is constrained, a shipper willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate. \"When there are more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata basis if required by its tariff.\" The example cited by the Commission: If a pipeline has 100 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a negotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata basis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some other allocation method such as lottery). When TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added the statement that \"if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate.\" Presumably we had concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order to receive negotiated rate authority.

The people have spoken and been counted twice by a computerized process. Now you have fought to pick and select certain counties in which to hand count and \"further allow the people to have a voice\". The voice you want to hear can be created through your legal manipulations, which by the way, you learned well through your boss over these past few years (great job on copying his character, sir). But the genuine voice of the people has already been heard. And since it wasn't the voice YOU wanted to hear, now is being overruled by your political ploys. I have always been so proud of America. I've lived overseas for graduate work and travel frequently overseas for the work I do. But now, sir, I am ashamed. You have shown complete lack of integrity and character. You do not care, sir, about this country. You clearly care much more about your obtaining this office. You do not care, sir, about the voice of the people, but rather that the right voices be heard and all others squelched. I am ashamed of you and find this completely a disgrace to the office you are so bitterly and petulantly fighting for and a disgrace to the nation. Our America was built on integrity, character and honor. You sir, have gutted that foundation. Do you recall the phrase \"God's Country\" -- it still is, sir.

The people have spoken and been counted twice by a computerized process. Now you have fought to pick and select certain counties in which to hand count and \"further allow the people to have a voice\". The voice you want to hear can be created through your legal manipulations, which by the way, you learned well through your boss over these past few years (great job on copying his character, sir). But the genuine voice of the people has already been heard. And since it wasn't the voice YOU wanted to hear, now is being overruled by your political ploys. I have always been so proud of America. I've lived overseas for graduate work and travel frequently overseas for the work I do. But now, sir, I am ashamed. You have shown complete lack of integrity and character. You do not care, sir, about this country. You clearly care much more about your obtaining this office. You do not care, sir, about the voice of the people, but rather that the right voices be heard and all others squelched. I am ashamed of you and find this completely a disgrace to the office you are so bitterly and petulantly fighting for and a disgrace to the nation. Our America was built on integrity, character and honor. You sir, have gutted that foundation. Do you recall the phrase \"God's Country\" -- it still is, sir. And you someday will have to discuss this with Him directly. He also favors truth and justice.

First, be sure to contact the convention hotel and make your reservations. At last count there were only 6 rooms left. Second, I need a completed application form from everyone so that we can get an accurate meal count. I am attaching the program announcement so you can fill out the appropriate boxes for meals and numbers of guests in the event you have not sent in a form. Remember that we are starting the conference off with a luncheon on Friday so plan on arriving early Friday or coming in on Thursday evening if you can. Our hotel is right on the river and there are lots of restaurants and interesting things to visit in the immediate area (the Alamo is across the plaza from the hotel). We are making plans for spouses and children to attend both the dinner on Friday and Saturday evenings. The Friday evening dinner begins at 6 p.m. so that we can be done in plenty of time for our private guided tour of the Alamo at 8:00 p.m. For Saturday we are still working out plans for the evening so stay tuned. There will be more information later as the conference nears. Looking forward to seeing you all and in beautiful, sunny San Antonio. John - announcerev.doc John D. Martin Carr P.

The companies will take a leadership role to facilitate the utilization of Internet technology to enhance service to customers and increase efficiency with suppliers. The electronic marketplace will create a foundation for common industry standards to simplify and accelerate the adoption of electronic commerce across the industry. The marketplace will operate as an independent entity with its own board of directors and management team. Initially, the three founding companies will each have an equal equity position, but it is expected that more partners will join the initiative. Based on demonstrated success, the companies will consider taking the entity public. The paper and forest products industry in the United States ships more than $200 billion worth of products annually. By working together to establish an electronic marketplace, the three leading companies in the industry believe they can benefit customers by simplifying transaction processes, improving information flow and increasing speed of delivery, thereby reducing costs. Providing both procurement and sales functions means the on-line marketplace will also enable participating companies to streamline purchasing operations, reduce inventories, cut internal costs and increase capital efficiency in the industry. The three companies immediately will begin conducting a search for a chief executive officer for the new operation and are assessing potential technology partners to add state-of-the-art expertise to the enterprise. The companies plan to promptly complete a definitive agreement, finalize a business plan and enlist additional strategic partners, including forest products companies and affiliated industry firms. John T. Dillon, International Paper's chairman and chief executive officer, said, \"This is a substantial commitment on the part of three industry leaders to develop a comprehensive electronic marketplace for the forest and paper sector. As manufacturers, marketers and distributors of a broad array of products, we will collectively bring expertise and resources to this effort.\" A.D. \"Pete\" Correll, Georgia-Pacific's chairman and chief executive officer, said, \"This is a bold move for the paper and forest products industry.

SportsLine.com has learned that Jaguars running back Fred Taylor met with the specialist Tuesday morning and was told that his injured groin is still not healed. Taylor has been practicing the past three weeks and the Jaguars had hoped he would have been back in the lineup already. However, he has been unable to run full speed and now comes word that he will continue be sidelined. \"Dr. Uribe said he has a major injury and that after eight weeks, it's still not healed and is going to take some more time getting healthy,\" Taylor's agent Drew Rosenhaus said. \"He wasn't sure specifically how much time Fred would miss but it's a major tear, he tore the groin muscle off the bone. Dr. Uribe said this is the type of injury that could often take a minimum of three months before it is healed.\" Taylor injured the groin in the first half of the team's second game of the year. He made a cut in the middle of the field and suddenly stopped, let go of the ball and dropped. \"It's going to be very unfair for anyone to assume he will play any time in the immediate future,\" said Rosenhaus. \"He's just not healthy yet. He can't run full speed without tremendous pain. The Jaguars have done a very good job in working him but he's still in pain. \"It's not just the groin but he also has pain in the hip now, which is an off-shoot of the groin. But he's still healing and he shouldn't play at this time and when the Jaguars talk to him later today, I'm sure they'll have the same feeling.\" In Taylor's absence, the Jaguars have played musical chairs in the backfield. Stacey Mack has been the primary replacement, but youngsters Frank Moreau and Elvis Joseph have also been given shots. Mack started Sunday's game and will likely remain with the first team in the immediate future. \"He's doing everything he can to get back in as soon as possible,\" said the Florida-based agent. \"Remember, we entered the season primed to play and receive a big contract extension so nobody wants in there more than Fred. \"But the doctor recommends that he is progressing at a good pace and it depends on how the injury heals. He said he has seen guys miss an entire season with this. But at the same time, it's such a vague injury. Fred may wake up next week and suddenly feel great. At the same time, it could take several weeks. We don't know. We only know he's healing but shouldn't play at this time.\" [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ OUR VIEW ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] This makes sense as the Jaguars have been very vague about Taylor's health. Clearly, bad news for Taylor owners. Stacey Mack and Elvis Joseph get an extension but they've come up pretty small so far. As Dr. Coshal, our Footballguys.com Team Doc mentioned way back when Taylor was injured, this is a serious deal. Stay tuned but for now it's not looking good.

These will be Category 2 seating which I've been guaranteed is great. It seems that Category 1 seating has been scooped up by season ticket holders and other groups that also had early purchase opportunities - BMC alone is ordering over 500 tickets for its employees with our 23 tickets included in that number. Anyway, these tickets are $50 instead of $60 so those of you who have already put your checks in the mail will get a refund from me at some point. In the meantime, we can all mark up our calendars for the 19th of January.

As the state's booming economy taxes the ability to meet electricity demands, a federal investigation is underway. CHRIS KRAUL TIMES STAFF WRITER Aug. 28, 2000 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page A-1 Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company With Southern Californians reeling from skyrocketing electric bills, critics charge that fewer than a dozen power suppliers are reaping far greater profits than are justified by the recent surge in wholesale prices of the natural gas they use to create electricity. Their behavior is a major focus of a formal investigation announced last week by federal regulators. Among those under scrutiny are power merchants including <B>Duke</B> <B>Energy</B>, <B>Dynegy</B>, <B>Reliant</B> <B>Energy</B>, Calpine, Southern Co. and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Critics say the companies are earning huge windfalls selling energy to the two state agencies charged with distributing power in California. The power merchants themselves deny any profiteering, describing their market moves as legal business practices and welcoming the investigation. The underlying cause of California's energy turmoil is a severe shortage of power-generating capacity to meet the soaring energy demands of the state's booming economy. This summer the state at times has had to import more than 20% of its energy needs, a shortfall equal to the output of about 20 medium-size power plants. No plants of any size have been built in the state in 10 years. But the problem goes beyond a supply-and-demand imbalance. The so-called merchant power companies' ability to bend the market to their advantage--using what appear to be legal strategies--illustrates what many say are serious flaws in the state's deregulated energy market. One major flaw is that sellers do not have to participate in the state's main electricity auction--the so-called \"day forward\" sale held one day before electricity is delivered to the state's residences and businesses. Instead, generators are withholding power until the day of delivery, when desperate state agencies are willing to pay steep prices to keep the power flowing. The upshot has been a doubling of electric bills for the 1.2 million customers in San Diego Gas&Electric's coverage area, and Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas&Electric customers may be facing higher prices once their rates are unfrozen in 2002. There is little prospect for short-term relief; with no additional power generation due for a year, the prices of natural gas and crude oil are still rising. In fact, state officials expect the market to become tighter over the next year as demand and fuel prices rise. In pointing the finger at the power merchants, Gov. Gray Davis, some academics and utility executives charge that California consumers are being victimized by sophisticated trading techniques that take advantage of the market system to extract huge profits.

{"subject": "Re: EOL Stationery", "body": "Dear Justin, Have spoken with Dave Minns just now and I think he is going to spk with you. I don't think I have been clear enough and I am sorry. We here at Enron Japan have no particular desire (or resources at the moment) to send out EOL related correspondence from here. If, however, EOL decides it is better for EOL related correspondence with Japanese counterparties to go from Enron Japan Corp. (as the legal entity responsible for the content of a letter) rather than any other Enron entity, then we will have to review and sign the correspondence (since it will create legal obligations for us) or have someone else sign pursuant to a limited power of attorney. If you want the letters to go from Enron Japan Corp. and for the EOL logo to be on the paper then we would also need to consider whether we (EJ) needed to register the logo as a business / trade name here. I am not sure whether this has been done. (Also note that at the moment although the Japanese version of the letterhead refers to \"Enron Japan Corp.\", the English translation says \"EnronOnLine\". In any case these should be consistent I would think. On the other hand, if the correspondence can go from EOL LLC, or another Enron legal entity then we do not need to be involved and I think this would be our preference. I know that the Enron Metals people here are trying to convert their customers over to EOL. The EJ traders are also trying to sell EOL in the market. The time therefore may come when we prefer to \"personalize\" our EOL dealings by having them sent from EJ or Enron Metals out of Tokyo but I don't think that time has quite come yet. As a separate issue, if EOL wants to use the Enron Japan address in Tokyo on its letters to Japanese counterparties, it may have to register a branch and this may have unexpected tax implications for EOL LLC.

My voicemail was full on Monday - when I checked in with Keegan on Monday late morningshe advised me of such and I deleted the calls periodically. I do realize that I do get a lot of calls and emails due to the 50 or so brokerage related agreements & the numerous deals I am working on so I do try to clear the box daily. (2) I can be of more assistance in the future if, instead of telling Keegan you need a file, that you contact me directly. That way, I can make sure that you get what you need. I took a lot of Enron calls and faxes while on vacation so I would not have objected had you contacted me directly. That way we do not have to put the burden on Keegan to locate my files -- although I am sure she is more than willing to help, I do not think she knows much about where I keep particular files or documents. (3) Also with respect to Keegan, I wanted to relay to you that she felt uncomfortable being quizzed by you or passing judgment as to why I have chosen to receive orthodontal treatment in New York rather than in Houston. (The answer to the question is irrelevant. If I were getting treatment across the street from the office, I still could be here to do any work. My getting the treatment in New York, while I am on vacation, does not affect my presence in the office or undermine in any way my ability to do my job). Equally important, apparently these were not fair questions of Keegan, as she has informed me that they made her feel uncomfortable and she only answered because she sensed or thought she was obligated to do so. Nor do I think they are fair of me. I do not wish to justify my medical decisions with my colleagues, especially provided that I am taking vacation time or sick time I rightfully can take.

Nor do I think they are fair of me. I do not wish to justify my medical decisions with my colleagues, especially provided that I am taking vacation time or sick time I rightfully can take. It was previously represented to me that our department policy is that when out for medical reasons, we should provide in an email or otherwise convey a general statement - the details are not required. If that is not the policy then please advise. In any case, if for some justifiable reason you have to know such information and you need to rely on it, it is best to ask me directly so that you can be sure that the information you are getting is accurate.

{"subject": "glom: M-W's Word of the Day", "body": "*************************************************************** Did you know Julius Caesar moved January to the head of the year? Click here for your guide to word histories. http://www.m-w.com/book/literead/wordhist.htm *************************************************************** The Word of the Day for January 8 is: glom \\GLAHM\\ (verb) *1 : take, steal 2 : seize, catch Example sentence: \"Nobody needs to glom my favorite hairbrush anymore,\" Liz told her three teenage daughters, \"now that I've bought each of you one just like it.\" Did you know? It's a classic case of glomming.

Looks like the only thing that is going to happen will be a Budget without anything on energy restructuring (could continue to change). There will be some additional negotiating on SBX2 78 over the recess. Enron is looking for a way into those discussions (Jeff Dasovich). We will try to push good language on DA dates and assignment of Utility and CDWR costs. On another note, CDWR has announced its revenue requirements going forward. The numbers are significantly less than had previously been expected (due to lower costs for spot market purchases). The end result, if their figures are correct, is that the March 27 3c/kwh increase would be sufficient going forward (we are trying to validate). The key is that now the Retained Generation proceedings will determine if any more $ is needed from retail customers.

This largely represents TURN's proposal. The Senate also passed a budget and has since adjourned until August 20. The Assembly had been considering two MOUs, ABX 82 (Keeley) and ABX 50 (Wright). Both bills had difficulty attracting a majority of votes given their different approaches to dealing with SCE. ABX 82 for example, had large users picking up most of the tab for SCE's undercollection whereas ABX 50 split those charges among all users. Both bills provided for some type of direct access and ABX 82 also provided for a purchase of the transmission system. In light of the difficulty in passing either bill, it appears as if the Assembly will shelve both proposals today in order to amend SBX 78 over the summer break. An internal legislative working group may be formed to draft amendments but this has not been confirmed. Large users have begun drafting extensive am\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

{"subject": "Alternative work schedule status", "body": "As you might already know we had to reschedule our second meeting that was scheduled for Wednesday 2/16 to Tuesday 2/22 in room 3013. Lunch will be provided. I apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future. I was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we know are needed in our work hours. Here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting: Schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss at the next meeting. Each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting Bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow up with HR on schedules being used at Enron The following is what I heard at the first meeting: Our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that would more or less guarantee (other than maybe an occasional call) you have the weekend off. Cross-training seemed to be the key here. Some desks seemed to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels. Cross-training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a \"just do it\" attitude. There doesn't have to be an across the board solution for Logistics. However all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk changes. Late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders willingness to do deals at any time.

DF From: Bob Chandler 06/29/2000 10:26 AM To: Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc: Rod Hayslett/FGT/Enron@Enron, Allison Millan/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Elaine Concklin/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Bill Cordes/ET&S/Enron@ENRON Subject: ET&S 2nd Quarter Earnings As you know we have been developing a list of possible earnings items to be moved out of 2nd quarter. The list now totals $7.5MM and has been approved by Stan and Rod. We're now in the \"make it happen\" stage. We have 3 items that we'll need your assistance with: Increasing the Conoco litigation reserve from $1.0mm that we now have on the books to a new balance of $3.0MM -- a $2MM increase. To accomplish this we need a memo from you to request and support the increase. The fact that we laid $3MM cash on the settlement table is good. It you mention that it was $3MM plus Hobbs 12\" line, then please qualify that with an indication that the market value of that line is de minimus. Increasing the accrual for the Duke/Coyanosa obligation from $600,000 to $800,000. I'm not sure what the basis for this increase is (continuing cost incurrence?), but your help in supporting the increase is solicited. Need a copy of the SBA Transaction Fee agreement with TransCanada Energy Marketing so that we can accrue (and expense) the obligation in June (assuming it's not payable until July). As we discussed earlier this week, we also need this document for AA's final review of base gas sale documents.\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

CC list suppressed... December 13, 2000 Energy Price Volatility May Hurt Utilities' Credit By REBECCA SMITH Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Recent volatility in wholesale energy markets is undermining the credit ratings and may eventually crimp the borrowing ability of some of the nation's biggest utilities, long regarded in the credit markets as some of the safest bets around. It is the worst out West, where the price of power to be delivered Wednesday hit a new high of $1,182 per megawatt hour on California's state-sanctioned auction, a benchmark for the entire region. That compares with $30 a year ago. But even utilities in the East, such as GPU Inc. of Parsippany, N.J., and Consolidated Edison of New York, also are at risk because they are paying higher prices than ever for spot-market electricity purchases and aren't always able to pass along that cost to their customers. As an indication of just how bad things are getting, Moody's Investors Service Tuesday put Seattle City Light on \"negative outlook,\" even though it is one of the lowest-cost generators in the nation. There hasn't been much rain in the Northwest this year and the city-owned utility has been forced to go to the wholesale market this month to buy 100 to 200 megawatts of electricity each day. That isn't much energy, but with prices that have gone as high as $1,000 per megawatt hour this week, compared with the $24 per megawatt hour that the municipal utility pays for power from the federal hydroelectric system, costs add up fast. The utility, which issued $100 million in bonds this week, is raising rates 10%, effective Jan. 1, and will keep the rate increase in effect as long as it takes to dig its way out. \"Prices are at absurd levels,\" says Seattle City Light Superintendent Gary Zarker. \"I know others are looking at significant rate increases too.\" Credit-rating agencies say they are going through their utility portfolios and separating those with exposure to wholesale markets from those that have enough in-house generation to meet customer demand. Then they are trying to figure out which of the ones that are forced to buy on the spot market will be allowed to pass on higher costs and which ones won't. \"You have the makings of a credit crunch when utilities are required to buy power but aren't allowed to pass the cost through,\" says Steven Fetter, managing director of the global power unit at Fitch, the New York credit-rating agency. That is exactly the position California's biggest investor-owned utilities are in. Southern California Edison Co., a unit of Edison International, and Pacific Gas and Electric Co., a unit of PG&E Corp., have incurred deficits in excess of $7 billion buying power on the open market since June and were forced to pay higher rates and offer unprecedented guarantees to investors when they last issued bonds. While they are still making money from the power plants they own, it is nowhere near enough to make up for the shortfall. Credit ratings of both utilities were lowered this week. Blown the Lid Off There is no cost relief in sight. California's grid operator last week lifted a price cap for power it buys each hour to keep supply matched with demand. That helped reliability because more generators came forward and offered energy through an orderly market, instead of waiting for harried engineers to call them at the last minute trying to strike a deal. But it has really blown the lid off prices in the West.

It should be noted that a vote is pending in the Argentine Congress (had been expected today) to adjust the convertibility law in Argentina to allow a basket of euros and U.S. dollars in equal weights (once parity is reached for euro-dollar) that would replace the existing one-for-one peso to US dollar currency board. The economy ministry took a first step toward this new basket regime by introducing this week a dual-exchange rate system for the traded sector that allows Argentine exporters to benefit from the weaker euro by receiving export earnings in line with a mixed basket of 50% euros and 50% US dollars. At today's spot rates, this implies an 8% depreciation of the peso vis-a-vis the basket. An 8% devaluation at this juncture does not gain the kind of competitiveness needed by Argentine exporters to help boost economy when a major trading partner, Brazil, has depreciated 21% vis-a-vis the USD since the beginning of this year. Initial reports indicate that consumer and corporate borrowers, however, would still pay debt service at the dollar peg exchange rate (one-for-one).

Last year there were about 100 delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk management for the energy sector. The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around using our software. This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

The subject could be: * a general energy risk related topic * a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in the energy markets * your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation, food and drink.

Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission. Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors. New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming. In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses. All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation. Pre-Petition Expenses We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000. We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000. However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses. This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel. We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses. We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000. Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap. Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.

{"subject": "Tenaska IV 11/00", "body": "I am having trouble with the transport deal for the Tenaska IV contracts on Lone Star. We have deal 452491 in Sitara for meter 20014804 at a $0.01 transport rate. We received the statement from TXU Lone Star and it does not agree with our deal. They are billing for meter 25000200 at $0.10 and meter 20014903 at $0.02. These meters relate to the Tenaska IV sale deal 384258 and the Tenaska Marketing deal 459898, respectively. Should our deal match what TXU is billing or is there another deal that I am missing? I haven't worked with transport very much, so I could be confused. I think we have this problem with Oct 2000, also, but I have not reviewed it yet. I am going to look at it this afternoon. Tenaska IV has already reimbursed us for the TXU transport, so we will need to pay this next week. Also, now that we have the actuals for Nov 2000, we need to update the demand fees to reflect the correct volumes.

They are billing for meter 25000200 at $0.10 and meter 20014903 at $0.02. These meters relate to the Tenaska IV sale deal 384258 and the Tenaska Marketing deal 459898, respectively. Should our deal match what TXU is billing or is there another deal that I am missing? I haven't worked with transport very much, so I could be confused. I think we have this problem with Oct 2000, also, but I have not reviewed it yet. I am going to look at it this afternoon. Tenaska IV has already reimbursed us for the TXU transport, so we will need to pay this next week.

{"subject": "Time Magazine - Enron Plays the Pipes....", "body": "This article is forwarded to you per Mark Palmer's request... Business Enron Plays The Pipes This old-time gas company is trading fuel for a future as a new-economy superpower. Will the swap work? Frank Gibney Jr./Houston 08/28/2000 Time Magazine Time Inc. 38+ (Copyright 2000) It's Saturday night, and the only thing between you and a movie from Blockbuster Video is the unpaid late fee for last week's rental. If that sounds familiar, then you'll appreciate this: next year Blockbuster plans to offer up to 500 movie titles online in more than a dozen major cities around the U.S. That's right, video on demand (not the frustrating no-rewind, no-pause pay-per-view offerings of today) for anyone with a DSL line at home. What's remarkable is that Blockbuster's partner happens to be an energy company called Enron. At a time when so many old-economy companies seem helpless against the dizzying pace and technology of the digital age, Enron is demonstrating why FORTUNE magazine keeps voting it the most innovative large company in America. For years the Houston-based firm simply produced, transported and marketed natural gas. Then, as energy deregulation threatened profit margins in the gas business, Enron discovered it could make billions by trading and brokering packages of energy the way Midwesterners do pork bellies. Now Enron is moving into the telecommunications business, with a national fiber-optic cable network and a floor bulging with Sun supercomputers. In fact, Enron may be the most interesting old-economy company around. Since moving its trading operations from the phone to the Web eight months ago, the company has doubled revenues to more than $30 billion. Most of that is made through trading everything from energy and paper to weather risk derivatives and now bandwidth--more than 800 offerings in all. Think of eBay, but instead of auctioning $5 used Baby Gap pajamas, the company trades $600,000 blocks of natural gas--and pockets commensurately huge commissions. Boasts Enron president Jeffrey Skilling: \"In terms of dollars transacted, we're the world's largest online site by a factor of 10.\" So far this year, that has meant $120 billion in transactions. And when you're running the network, all sorts of profitable opportunities arise. Last week, when word spread that natural-gas prices would spike this winter, Enron's in-house traders saw their gains surge as customers raced to lock in future supplies at today's prices. And Enron's stock price? It hit $90 last week, tripling its value of a year ago. Kind of like an Internet play, only better. The market loves Enron because Skilling and CEO Kenneth Lay seem to have come up with a business model that works for just about anything. They provide a service to their customers by packaging a supply of name your commodity and then using the efficiency of their vast network to beat most prices. They arrived at this model back in the mid-1980s almost out of desperation, when crude-oil prices had collapsed, natural-gas deregulation had thrown that market into chaos, and the Peruvian government had just nationalized Enron's offshore properties. Figuring they might as well leverage deregulation instead of succumbing to it--call it business judo-- Skilling, a McKinsey & Co. consultant at the time, came up with a plan called the Gas Bank, to buy up reserves of natural gas, then package them for sale, with various prices and conditions for different customers. When electricity markets deregulated a few years ago, the company did the same. It's the oldest concept in business: buy low, sell high. Enron also leverages its assets and expertise to provide services to big customers. Since 1997, companies like Owens Corning and Chase Manhattan Bank have signed long-term, multibillion-dollar contracts with Enron subsidiary Enron Energy Services (EES) that lock in their energy costs for up to 10 years and provide Enron with a steady revenue stream.
