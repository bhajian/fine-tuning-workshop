I am running the Houston Marathon for the Leukemia Society. I made a fundraising commitment of $2000. I have raised $1000 and have been waiting for the Enron match of $1000 from the matching gifts program. The request was submitted well in advance of the cutoff deadline that was announced via e-mail a few weeks before the layoffs. The Leukemia Society has not yet received the match. If Enron does not come up with the match, I am personally on the hook for this $1000, and in light of the small severance situation, it is going to be really tough for me right now. Do you have any information on whether or not the Enron commitment will be honored as was communicated in the e-mail? Do you have any idea when the funds will be sent to the Leukemia Society?

With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours. 2. With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section (b), I believe that both parties need to make such reps. The rep in Part 5 (b)(g)(ii) is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep below it. 3. With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different from the setoff language. What this is saying is that if a party has fulfilled all of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to it (the \"Defaulting Party\"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that it owes to the Defaulting Party. This is different from the exercise of setoff rights. 4. I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the removal of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration apply. 5. We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US Dollars. 6. Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i), (ii). Why do you want to delete it?

What this is saying is that if a party has fulfilled all of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to it (the \"Defaulting Party\"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that it owes to the Defaulting Party. This is different from the exercise of setoff rights. 4. I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the removal of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration apply. 5. We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US Dollars. 6. Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i), (ii). Why do you want to delete it? I look forward to hearing from you. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) E-Mail Carol.St.Clair@enron.com\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

{"subject": "Re: Fw: Money in Politics Alert -- July 17, 2001", "body": "Dear John: You're opening my flood gates, and I'm going to refrain from getting entirely upset. Please read the attached letter, which is the one that we sent to Dunn last week. To wit: according to the ISO's own calculations, Enron represents FOUR TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT--that's four-tenths of one percent---of the alleged \"overcharges.\" John, combined, the government sellers, including CA munis have, by the ISOs own calculations, \"overcharged\" California by a factor of ONE HUNDRED times what Enron has alleged to have \"overcharged.\" (See letter from Winters to Burton and Ose.) So notes like this, are ill-informed. I'm looking forward to Mr. Marcus and others directing their invective at SMUD, Glendale, Pasadena, Burbank and LADWP. Nettie Hoge is now being quoted as saying, \"well, it's not the gouging. that's not the problem. it's the \"profit motive\" we've set up that's the problem.\" so munis are victims of a disease (profits) they can't control. everyone else is blood-sucking scum. (in addition, please inform Bill that Sempra's contract with DWR is a drop in the bucket compared to others. it's easy and perhaps even good politics to go after Sempra, but getting Sempra ain't going to come within a light year of solving our DWR contract problem.)

{"subject": "California Assembly Releases \"Modified MOU\" for Edison", "body": "Please forward to others who need this information. As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor. Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group. The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not yet been completed. The URL for the bill is attached. Based on a meeting attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is attached) are: Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on the effective date of the bill) Transmission sale at 2X book. Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by customers 20KW and above. Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits, investigations, etc.) The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts and what the payment structure will look like. Reaction and Timetable Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong possibility. Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed Republicans are strongly opposed Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access. Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts. AB82XX does not address this issue. Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a \"modified MOU.\" Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their \"modified\" MOU this weekend or early next week. The Assembly will hold an \"informational\" hearing on the bill tomorrow (Saturday) to get members up to speed The Assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on Monday, with the intent of sending the bill to the full Assembly for a vote on Tuesday. The Legsilature is supposed to have a month-long recess beginning Friday, July 20th, which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get resolved by then, or suspend the recess and continue working Will continue to provide updates as events unfold. If folks have additional comments on the bill, please direct them to Harry Kingerski and Leslie Lawner, who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in Sacramento.

Provided below are some items I would have mentioned in the Monday staff meeting: Plains Farmer's Coop - To date, I have been able to collect approximately half of the $500,000 imbalance which Plains Coop owes TW. I will be meeting Charles Hough in Friona (Friona is located 100 miles west of Amarillo) on Monday to discuss the payment plan for the remaining imbalance amount in additionaI to other general business matters. I discussed my action plan with legal and credit and will request full payment by January 31, 2000, latest date. Effective Febrary 1st, TW will also include penalty payments with any future imbalance outside the +/- 10% tolerance level. Pogo Producing - I met recently with John Havard with Pogo. Pogo plans to spud a well in Eddy county which is an offset to the EOG operated well recently completed and in the process of being attached to TW. Pogo's well will be spud in December with an expected 60 day drill & completion time. They have an optimistic expectation of the production being close to the EOG well - current initial production of 14 MMcf/d, and have plans for additional drilling in the field area. CIG - A conference call was held with CIG on Friday to discuss delivery performance issues of deliveries to the CIG/Tumbleweed point and the ability of them to increase their delivery capacity to Transwestern. They explained that CIG is currently fully subscribed and operating at MAOP along the line which provides deliveries to Transwestern, El Paso, NNG and SPS/Nichols. All shippers holding capacity along this line (capacity 200 MMcf/d) already have subscribed to long term contracts primarily to El Paso and SPS. Currently they have no operational capability to provide any more incremental delivery capabilities to TW at Tumbleweed. However, they have indicated a probable second Raton Expansion project will be announced March 2001 and have suggested that looping of this southern line could be a possible outcome of the project which would provide incremental delivery capacity to Transwestern above the current 40 MMcf/d level. I will be having additional discussions with CIG marketing individuals to determine who, besides El Paso and Evergreen, are the primary existing shippers down the southern portion of CIG's system in order to potentially get them to realign their contract to Transwestern as a primary delivery point. Expedition of Contracting Process - Per Kevin's request, I provided him, and also discussed, several ideas which would streamline and improve the existing contract processing cycle. The most important and critical recommendation was to revise the 3 year old ET&S Discounting Policy which Bill Cordes had established for both TW and Northern. Obtaining approval of even a few simple changes I could recommend to the Policy (applicable only to Transwestern, not NNG) would have an immediate effect of simplying the Officer approval process and would expedite the turn-around time.", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

{"subject": "EPA Mercury Determination", "body": "EPA's Mercury determination was released today. It can be accessed at www.epa.gov/mercury It will likely take some time for EPA to develop these regulations -- the time frame is proposed rule by 2003 and final rule by 2004 -- but this is a significant step in that it now formally puts mercury on the radar screen for power generators, in terms of planning for emissions controls. It is a positive step that EPA included in its determination an intent to develop \"flexible\" compliance measures -- i.e. trading -- for mercury. It also means that mercury will most likely be included in any efforts to develop \"multi-pollutant\" legislation in the next Congress. Please call me if you have any questions. _________________ THURSDAY, DEC. 14, 2000 EPA DECIDES MERCURY EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS MUST BE REDUCED To protect public health and the environment, EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner today announced that the Clinton Administration will require reductions, for the first time ever, of harmful mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants -- the largest source of such emissions in America. After extensive study, EPA determined mercury emissions from power plants pose significant hazards to public health and must be reduced. The agency will propose regulations by 2003 and issue final rules by 2004. \"Mercury from power plants settles over waterways, polluting rivers and lakes, and contaminating fish. Exposure to mercury poses real risks to public health, especially to children and developing fetuses,\" Browner said. \"The greatest source of mercury emissions is power plants, and they have never been required to control these emissions before now. Today's decision to address this problem marks a major step forward in the Clinton Administration's ongoing efforts to protect public health and the environment.\" Exposure to mercury has been associated with both neurological and developmental damage in humans. The developing fetus is the most sensitive to mercury's effects, which include damage to nervous system development. People are exposed to mercury primarily through eating fish that have been contaminated when mercury from power plants and other sources is deposited to water bodies. Once mercury enters water, biological processes can transform it into methylmercury, a highly toxic form of mercury that builds up in animal and human tissues. EPA recommends that subsistence fisherman, pregnant women, and others should always heed state fishing advisories. Under the Clean Air Act, EPA is required to study toxic air pollution from power plants in order to determine if additional regulations are necessary in order to protect public health. EPA reported its study to Congress in February 1998. That study concluded that of all toxic pollution examined, mercury posed the greatest concern to public health. An earlier study concluded that the largest source of human-made mercury pollution in America was coal-fired power plants. After completion of the study, the Clean Air Act required EPA to determine whether to proceed with the development of regulations. Today, EPA is announcing that it has affirmatively decided that mercury air emissions from power plants should be regulated, because mercury poses the greatest hazards to public health. EPA will propose regulations by December 2003 and will begin developing those regulations shortly. Industry, the public, and state, local and tribal governments will have an opportunity to participate in the process. Then, EPA will issue final regulations by December 2004. The Clinton Administration already has taken a number of aggressive actions to reduce mercury air pollution, including significantly reducing allowable emissions from municipal waste combustors, medical waste incinerators and hazardous waste combustors. When fully implemented in 2005, the existing rules will reduce total human-caused mercury emissions by nearly 50 percent from 1990 levels nationwide.

Exposure to mercury poses real risks to public health, especially to children and developing fetuses,\" Browner said. \"The greatest source of mercury emissions is power plants, and they have never been required to control these emissions before now. Today's decision to address this problem marks a major step forward in the Clinton Administration's ongoing efforts to protect public health and the environment.\" Exposure to mercury has been associated with both neurological and developmental damage in humans. The developing fetus is the most sensitive to mercury's effects, which include damage to nervous system development. People are exposed to mercury primarily through eating fish that have been contaminated when mercury from power plants and other sources is deposited to water bodies. Once mercury enters water, biological processes can transform it into methylmercury, a highly toxic form of mercury that builds up in animal and human tissues. EPA recommends that subsistence fisherman, pregnant women, and others should always heed state fishing advisories. Under the Clean Air Act, EPA is required to study toxic air pollution from power plants in order to determine if additional regulations are necessary in order to protect public health. EPA reported its study to Congress in February 1998. That study concluded that of all toxic pollution examined, mercury posed the greatest concern to public health. An earlier study concluded that the largest source of human-made mercury pollution in America was coal-fired power plants. After completion of the study, the Clean Air Act required EPA to determine whether to proceed with the development of regulations. Today, EPA is announcing that it has affirmatively decided that mercury air emissions from power plants should be regulated, because mercury poses the greatest hazards to public health. EPA will propose regulations by December 2003 and will begin developing those regulations shortly. Industry, the public, and state, local and tribal governments will have an opportunity to participate in the process. Then, EPA will issue final regulations by December 2004. The Clinton Administration already has taken a number of aggressive actions to reduce mercury air pollution, including significantly reducing allowable emissions from municipal waste combustors, medical waste incinerators and hazardous waste combustors. When fully implemented in 2005, the existing rules will reduce total human-caused mercury emissions by nearly 50 percent from 1990 levels nationwide.

To: Doug Leach@ECT cc: Dan J Hyvl@ECT, Ermes Melinchon/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Amendment to Fuel Supply Doug: Following our conversation of last week, attached is the draft of the amendment to the fuel supply for your review and approval. As you may recall, this document became necessary after we became aware of the letter agreement dated August 12, 1996. If you have any questions, please give me a call, otherwise please let me know you are okay with it so that I can send it to the lenders for their review and approval. many thanks FPL\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

You continue to make it happen. We recognize that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron\u0001,s business goals, and we are pleased that many of you have shared in the company\u0001,s financial success through Enron stock options. As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as the All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided value to participants through 2000. Employees who have participated in this program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the program. Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron\u0001,s continued success. Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decided to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package. On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions \u0001) Your Stock Option Program).

The new program, which is subject to final approval by Enron\u0001,s Board of Directors, is as follows: ? EnronOptions \u0001) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and international companies/locations. ?

Find out more at: http://www.consultrci.com ************************************************************************ =============================================================== SCIENTECH IssueAlert, December 12, 2000 Powergen and LG&E Complete Merger By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis =============================================================== Powergen of the United Kingdom and LG&E Energy Corp. of Louisville, Ky., have completed their merger and have formally begun joint operations. LG&E will maintain its headquarters in Louisville, which will serve as the headquarters for Powergen's North American operations. LG&E Energy's utility subsidiaries, Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities Company, will continue as separate subsidiary corporations with joint operations and with headquarters in Louisville and Lexington, Ky., respectively. ANALYSIS: Although referred to as a \"merger,\" Powergen actually has acquired LG&E, a strong utility based in the Midwest that remains focused on all three core sectors of the electric utility business (generation, transmission and distribution). Powergen, which generates about 14 percent of the electricity used in England and Wales, is a company with clear intentions to expand internationally. The company currently has electric and gas operations in Europe, India, Asia and Australia. Together, the Powergen / LG&E combination reportedly will have assets of nearly $14 billion and total revenues of $9 billion, serving four million customers worldwide. The partnership marks the third acquisition of a U.S. electric utility by a foreign company, following ScottishPower's purchase of PacifiCorp and National Grid's purchase of the New England Electric System (NEES), both in 1999. It appears that with each subsequent foreign acquisition of a U.S. utility, the regulatory hurdles needed to complete the deal have become easier to pass. Powergen's reasons for wanting to acquire assets in the United States arise from needs similar to its U.K. counterparts. In the last ten years that have elapsed since the privatization and subsequent deregulation of electricity in the United Kingdom, the electric sector has become completely competitive in all areas, including domestic customers. Just as in U.S. deregulation, concerns about market power have restricted the domestic growth of U.K. companies, which is compounded by the limited size of the U.K. energy market. Consequently, companies like Powergen have developed unique skills both in the United Kingdom and overseas so that they can expand scale through opportunities abroad. Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the U.S. market and evaluated potential partnerships with several energy companies in this country, including Cinergy and Houston Industries (now Reliant), which all fizzled. LG&E is particularly appealing to Powergen because of the U.K. company's desire to establish a strong presence in the Midwest market. LG&E should be a good partner for Powergen, as the latter gains access to approximately 3.7 million customers. In addition, LG&E owns equity in and operates non-utility power plants in six states as well as in Spain; owns interest in three natural-gas distribution companies in Argentina; and owns CRC-Evans Pipeline International, a provider of specialty equipment to the natural-gas and oil pipeline construction industry. Altogether, LG&E's two utilities and numerous unregulated businesses total about $5 billion in assets, which should ", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

Luckily we have the non-DNRC people, the so-called In-duh-viduals, to do our manual labor. After Dogbert conquers the planet and makes the Induhviduals our personal servants, there will be no more fussing with parallel parking. A small team of Induhviduals will be stationed at every potential parking place, ready to lift your vehicle and gently place it near the curb. A second team will swoop in and tongue-clean your bumper to remove the fingerprints left by the first team. A third team will swoop in and take your vehicle to the landfill so you don't have to drive a car that's been slobbered on. I realize this sounds inefficient, but remember there are over six billion Induhviduals. It's important to keep them busy. Speaking of keeping busy... My Trip to New York City --------------------------------- I am writing this trip report while in New York City to do some PR for my new web site feature (The Lazy Entrepreneur at Dilbert.com). Because I am a famous cartoonist I am staying in a new hotel that costs $500 per night. That might impress those of you who live in huts made entirely of manure. But if you are familiar with NYC you are probably blowing coffee out your nose and slapping your donut flat in a fit of spastic laughter because you know what $500 buys in the Big Apple. Herein, I offer my description of the luxurious NYC hotel experience. I'm struck by the similarity between my situation and John Gotti's. We have similar careers: He's a convicted mob boss; I'm a cartoonist. But here the similarity ends, because his current living conditions are far more luxurious. My room is ever-so-slightly wider than the bed. If it were possible to make a room smaller than its bed, I would be in that room. I'm sure the hotel has hired a team of physicists to crack that nut. The television's remote control doesn't work, but that doesn't matter because you can reach the TV with your hand from almost any location in the room. The \"closet\" consists of a ten-inch metal pipe that sticks out from the wall, suitable for hanging upwards of three garments. Directly below the metal pipe is a safe for your valuables. This leaves plenty of space for your clothes, assuming you wear the same pants size as G.I. Joe. My heating/cooling system produces an inexplicable noise every five minutes. The noise sounds like a combination of a squeaky door opening and a sword being drawn from its scabbard. This is exactly the sort of noise you want to hear when you're trying to sleep in New York City. The shower has a playful feature. The only way you can get to the shower controls is by reaching around a barrier and placing your head directly under the showerhead. There's nothing like a snoot full of cold water to get your day started. As you probably know, New York City taxi drivers originate from many different countries. They compensate for their incomplete grasp of English by facing away from the passenger and mumbling. I learned to interpret their mumbles by the context. For example, a mumble when you get in the car means, \"You look handsome today. To what destination may I transport you?\" A mumble while slowing down and looking out a side window means, \"This is your destination. Have a wonderful day.

{"subject": "RE: Alberta PPA Financing", "body": "Mark, further to our converstaion this morning, I attach the latest version of the swap financing structure with RBC DS. The idea is to have the swaps prepay a funded amount which is then repaid through the swap structure over the term of the transactions (1 year). Please note that rather than determining the one year PV value of the funded amount and interest at time = 0 relative to a fixed price, with monthly settlements then occuring in the normal course based on market movements, I understand that it is neceassary to have interest payments settled monthly with a bullet principal repayment by settlement at the end of the one year term. Some explanatory notes: 1. Bill Bradford's group is putting the credit terms together. Once that occurs we will need to have drafts to RBC DS ASAP. 2. Enron Canada Corp.'s obligations will be guaranteed by Enron Corp. to the extent outlined in the credit worksheet. 3. It is fundamental to the structure for Global Finance that there not be any net collateral exposure. In other words, collateral thresholds must offset or mirror each other such that if, for exapmle, Enron Canada is required to provide $50MM of margin to RBC DS, Financing SPV will also have to provide $50MM of margin to Enron Canada Corp., notwithstanding that Enron Canada Corp. ought really not be exposed unless there is a market movement having an exposure value in excess of the funded amount of $300MM. (NOTE: The actual amount required to complete the purchase of the PPA is C$235,840,000, the first installment of C$58,960,000 having already been funded by an intercompany loan from Enron Canada Corp. to Enron Canada Power Corp.) 4. In terms of documentation, the swaps should be documented under ISDA Masters. I understand that there may be an ISDA Master in place between Royal Bank of Camada and Enron North America Corp. and also one in place also with Enron Corp. (this will need to be confirmed). As the transactions need to be at the Enron Canada Corp. level, however, I suggest that ISDA Masters need to be prepared between Enron Canada Corp. and RBC DS and between Enron Canada Corp. and Financing SPV on the same terms as the current ISDA Master between Enron North America Corp. (or Enron Corp.) and Royal Bank of Canada, subject to the credit terms provided by Credit. The individual transactions themselves would then be documentd on transaction Confirmation Letters. I am not fussed as to who prepares the paper and it might be easiest for your group to do so. Please also note that external legal opinions may be required in respect of Enron Canada Corp. and Enron Corp. Blakes is prepared to provide legal opinions for Enron Canada Corp. and whatever advice or support is necessary. 5. Once the funding occurs to Enron Canada Corp., it will be advanced by intercompany loan to Enron Canada Power Corp. to acquire the PPA, and I will look after this aspect of the transaction. 6. Please note that Enron Canada Power Corp. must put the Government in funds on Friday Spetember 22nd. ---------------------- Forwarded by Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT on 09/13/2000 09:12 AM --------------------------- Soma Ghosh 09/12/2000 05:41 PM To: Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT, Andre Templeman/CAL/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: RE: Alberta PPA ---------------------- Forwarded by Soma Ghosh/HOU/ECT on 09/12/2000 06:40 PM --------------------------- Soma Ghosh 09/12/2000 10:06 PM To: Cris Sherman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: RE: Alberta PPA Chris, As promised, I am forwarding details of 'SwapCo'.

Some explanatory notes: 1. Bill Bradford's group is putting the credit terms together. Once that occurs we will need to have drafts to RBC DS ASAP. 2. Enron Canada Corp.'s obligations will be guaranteed by Enron Corp. to the extent outlined in the credit worksheet. 3. It is fundamental to the structure for Global Finance that there not be any net collateral exposure. In other words, collateral thresholds must offset or mirror each other such that if, for exapmle, Enron Canada is required to provide $50MM of margin to RBC DS, Financing SPV will also have to provide $50MM of margin to Enron Canada Corp., notwithstanding that Enron Canada Corp. ought really not be exposed unless there is a market movement having an exposure value in excess of the funded amount of $300MM. (NOTE: The actual amount required to complete the purchase of the PPA is C$235,840,000, the first installment of C$58,960,000 having already been funded by an intercompany loan from Enron Canada Corp. to Enron Canada Power Corp.) 4. In terms of documentation, the swaps should be documented under ISDA Masters. I understand that there may be an ISDA Master in place between Royal Bank of Camada and Enron North America Corp. and also one in place also with Enron Corp. (this will need to be confirmed). As the transactions need to be at the Enron Canada Corp. level, however, I suggest that ISDA Masters need to be prepared between Enron Canada Corp. and RBC DS and between Enron Canada Corp. and Financing SPV on the same terms as the current ISDA Master between Enron North America Corp. (or Enron Corp.) and Royal Bank of Canada, subject to the credit terms provided by Credit. The individual transactions themselves would then be documentd on transaction Confirmation Letters. I am not fussed as to who prepares the paper and it might be easiest for your group to do so. Please also note that external legal opinions may be required in respect of Enron Canada Corp. and Enron Corp. Blakes is prepared to provide legal opinions for Enron Canada Corp. and whatever advice or support is necessary. 5. Once the funding occurs to Enron Canada Corp., it will be advanced by intercompany loan to Enron Canada Power Corp. to acquire the PPA, and I will look after this aspect of the transaction. 6. Please note that Enron Canada Power Corp. must put the Government in funds on Friday Spetember 22nd. ---------------------- Forwarded by Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT on 09/13/2000 09:12 AM --------------------------- Soma Ghosh 09/12/2000 05:41 PM To: Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT, Andre Templeman/CAL/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: RE: Alberta PPA ---------------------- Forwarded by Soma Ghosh/HOU/ECT on 09/12/2000 06:40 PM --------------------------- Soma Ghosh 09/12/2000 10:06 PM To: Cris Sherman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: RE: Alberta PPA Chris, As promised, I am forwarding details of 'SwapCo'.

The time that you have set aside for fasting sounds great. Rev. Jacque mentioned in the last meeting that we would discuss a time for all so that we could be on one accord.

All rights reserved. California is fast becoming the symbol for problems that can develop when the electric utility industry is deregulated. Since becoming the first state to deregulate its retail market, California has had several power shortages this summer in which consumers were hit with skyrocketing electric rates. In San Diego, rates doubled and even quadrupled in the last two months. There's so much public backlash that members of Congress from California will hold hearings this month to examine the problem. Trade groups that represent the utility companies and public power organizations say deregulation is not at fault, but rather the specific way in which California opened its markets without accounting for supply and demand. They say there's not enough power generation to meet demand. The state hasn't built any power plants for at least 10 years, in large part because of the resistance utilities face from environmentalists concerned about siting locations. The National Energy Marketers Association, which represents wholesale and retail energy marketers, warned that suggestions about placing price caps for wholesale power markets would backfire. Instead, the group says Congress and states should eliminate regulations that harm competition in wholesale and retail power markets. The group says the problem has been exacerbated by policies that increase the risk to build new power plants and a lack of uniformity for operating procedures and other requirements. California's utility problems have also become an issue in the presidential campaign. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader has called on the state legislature and Gov. Gray Davis to pass a rate rollback law that doesn't include a balloon payment to compensate utilities for the money they would lose during a rate decrease. \"Electricity deregulation really brings about a collision of interests,\" Nader said. \"It pits the interests of consumers - who are often unorganized and lack power against the interests of supplierswho are usually very organized, powerful and have a lot of money behind them. It shouldn't be that way.\" Energy Issues Divide Bush, Gore For the first time in 20 years, energy issues could emerge as a major issue in the presidential campaign. Both major candidates are trying to use the issue to their advantage. The Democrats argue that Texas Gov. George W. Bush and running mate Dick Cheney - who are well-known figures in the oil industry - are in the back pockets of oil companies that have lobbied to drill on more public lands. Republicans have criticized Vice President Gore for failing to develop a plan to address the country's long-term energy needs. The Republicans say that Gore and his running mate Joseph Lieberman are more concerned about winning the support of environmentalists than they are in developing an energy policy. Gore and Lieberman support the development of alternative energy sources and tax credits for energy-efficient vehicles. They also have promised to block energy companies from drilling for oil or natural gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska or along the coasts of California and Florida. Bush and Cheney favor increased domestic oil production to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Bush says he backs the moratorium on new drilling in Florida and California, but supports oil exploration in the Arctic refuge. Both Gore and Bush support new federal regulations that would require lower sulfur levels in gasoline and cleaner engines in cars.

Reply with only the label.\n### Email:\nSubject: Re: crestar / gulf aos contract....\nBody: Grant, The problem is that they do not want to assign the agreement. They want to do a partial assignment which is unacceptable unless we can severe the document so that we have two separate stand alone pieces of paper after the assignment. Talk to them about doing two Spot Confirmations, one for 0 to 8,400 MMBtu per day which would not be assignable, and the other one for 0 to 11,600 MMBtu per day which would be assignable to BP. Call me so that we can discuss. Grant Oh 03/19/2001 05:16 PM To: Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: crestar / gulf aos contract....

Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees. Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance. HOW TO ENROLL: 1. Print out the attached registration form. 2. Complete the form, but please note the following SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS: A. Fill out the student information completely, including your email address. B. In the Enrollment section, where it says \"Please enroll me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________\", C. In the Payment section: For the course at Enron, the tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.

The Texas MBA Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.

Lindsey, et al: Attached is PG&E's revised OFO Settlement Agreement based on our discussion and agreements at yesterday's Settlement Conference. Before getting into the details, I want to thank Lindsey and the other active parties for their diligence and willingness to negotiate constructively in order to reach consensus. The following highlights the changes, which are shown as revision-marks against our September 24 proposal. We've added a couple of \"clean-up\" changes not specifically addressed yesterday. I don't believe these should cause any problem. * \"Significantly\" is added under A. and B.1. * In section B.1, we have inserted the term \"Gas OFO Forum\" so when we talk about this forum outside the settlement, it has a specific name we all recognize and agree to. We have made changes elsewhere in the document to include this more formal title. We also included \"or customer\" as being able to join the Forum. * In B.2, we used the words provided yesterday by the parties with two exceptions: * First, the language was revised to make a six-month comparison of OFO reductions, rather than a quarterly comparison as we agreed, and * Second, we added the word \"other\" to modify \"members\" in two places so it is clear that PG&E is also a member of the Forum. * In B.3, we changed the term \"Settlement Parties\" to \"Gas OFO Forum\" to reflect the intent of the agreement. * In B.4, we added the sentence at the end as requested, but, per our discussion, did not remove our last sentence. We added more specific language on the balancing account to be clearer, and noted that this issue is not fully resolved pending feedback from a couple parties. * In C.1.g, we used the language provided, removing the one sentence as agreed, and we added a comma and an \"a\" in the last sentence. * We did not include the proposed change from the parties for C.1.f.(3) for more data, since per yesterday's discussion we already agreed to provide that data elsewhere. * In C.3.b.(7), we modified the language to reflect our discussion that we would use a 100% Performance Factor for the first customer-specific OFO, and then an average of the actual performance for subsequent customer-specific OFOs, but not less than 50%. We also agree to post the performance data and revised factor within 14 days of each customer-specific OFO, and if another customer-specific OFO is needed in that period, to use the prior factor. We also changed \"Settlement Parties\" to the \"Gas OFO Forum.\" Lastly, we changed the \"next session\" to \"an ongoing basis\" which better fits the continuous nature of the data and adjustments. * In C.4.a, although not discussed the group at the Settlement Conference, Ron Oechsler, on behalf of Palo Alto, pointed out that our description of the three days when cashouts were driven by market economics was not quite correct. We have reviewed his comment and concur, and have corrected the wording accordingly. This does not change this provision to modify the cash-out prices. * In C.5.e.(4), we added the monthly election option. * In D.3.c, we added the suggested language, but changed \"Settlement Parties\" to the \"Gas OFO Forum.\" * On Appendix A, Revised Tariffs, we added the new balancing account which would be part of the Preliminary Statement in PG&E's gas tariffs.

Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities, standard swaps, options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment flows should not be subject to withholding tax. However, to the extent that Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments, concern exists that imputed interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding tax. 2. Consumption Tax (VAT) and Excise Taxes Although Japan imposes a 5% consumption tax (VAT), financial transactions are generally not subject to the consumption tax, so cash settled derivative transactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax. Japan imposes various kinds of excise taxes. These excise taxes generally apply to physical importation and domestic sale and delivery of covered products and should generally not apply to purely financial derivatives transactions which reference commodity prices. 3. Collateral for Derivatives Transactions If Enron entities will take collateral from Japan-based customers in connection with derivative transactions, depending upon the specific arrangements, withholding tax liability might arise. For example, if an Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japan-based customer and pays interest on it, such interest payments could be subject to local withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer.

A sample can be viewed at: http://www.consultrci.com/web/infostore.nsf/Products/InfoGrid ************************************************************************ =============================================================== SCIENTECH IssueAlert, October 11, 2000 Online Niche Players Capitalize on Natural-Gas Shortage, Bypass Utilities By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis =============================================================== SmartEnergy, a Con Edison competitor, is offering New York and Westchester consumers price protection with the ability to lock-in today's natural-gas rates for a period of one year. In a separate announcement, myHomeKey.com announced that it will offer energy savings packages designed to reduce energy consumption and lower rates for customers in the face of rising energy costs. ANALYSIS: As reports continue to accumulate that a natural-gas shortage will send prices skyrocketing this winter (see my IssueAlert from Oct. 9 on the subject), the most common response from electric utilities has been to warn their customers that they will see higher rates over the next few months. I can point to several examples. Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy announced a few weeks back that its natural-gas customers could face heating bills that are 35 to 50 percent higher than their bills last winter. Dominion East Ohio has warned its residential customers that they can expect to pay about $70 more per month for natural gas from November through January. And the warnings are coming not only in the Midwest and Northeast\u0001*where low winter temperatures drive up energy bills every year\u0001*but in the West as well. In California, PG&E warns that its customers can expect to see their winter bills increase by about $25, to an average bill of $75 (compared to $50 last winter). These are just a few examples of utility companies across the United States playing damage control, trying to minimize the customer outrage when customers suddenly see their bills double or triple. Along with their warnings, these utilities give reasons\u0001*perhaps seen as excuses by the public\u0001*for the rising cost of energy. There is a shortage of natural gas across the country, brought about by a drop-off in production. It was an unusually hot summer, which depleted supplies for energy. Demand in general has grown to surprising levels. Meanwhile, start-up online companies that many of us have not even heard of are using the rise in natural-gas prices as a golden marketing opportunity, and attempting to take business away from traditional utility companies. SmartEnergy is a perfect example. In existence just since April 1999, SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers. According to EnergyGuide.com, for an average home in New York City, SmartEnergy's natural-gas rates typically have run about $189 per month, compared Con Edison's $140. Under its new promotion, SmartEnergy's plan for natural gas guarantees that New York City and Westchester gas customers who sign on with their service now will be locked into current natural-gas rates for the next 12 months. This promotion comes at an ideal time for those who opt to switch, as natural-gas prices should begin their projected sharp increase over the next few weeks. Based on recent forecasts, SmartEnergy is claiming that Con Edison customers who make the switch can expect to save up to 40 percent on their energy through the winter months.

Jim is right--we need to be prepared for anything. Bill- I heard today that PG&E has sent us a letter or otherwise communicated to us that they are looking for a letter from us on valuation and are going to challenge our setoffs.

In particular has Enron completed the process of obtaining quotes so that the amount of the Termination Payments is set. I'm concerned that PG&E would be more likely to hit the LC's once the amounts have been set. We'll be ready to file something if they try that, but I'd like a heads up so that we know the possibility is out there. ============================================================================== This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

The prices are in line with December balance-of-month forward prices in the Mid Columbia River market electricity hub, which hit $525/MWh, and January forward prices, which hit $475/MWh on Monday. Prices in the CalPX, which operates the state's day-of, day-ahead and block forward electricity market, are likely an indication of the prices the Independent System Operator is paying to secure that out-of-state generation, the CalPX source said. The California ISO, which must ensure the state's grid reliability and operates 75% of the state real-time market, declared a stage-one electrical emergency Monday, meaning operating reserves were below 7%. The ISO said 10,000 MW of power was off line, and issued a call to buy 3,000 MW out of state. It is strange that the CalPX would hit an across-the-board cap in the winter, as opposed to the traditional high-peak summer season, market sources said.

The prices are in line with December balance-of-month forward prices in the Mid Columbia River market electricity hub, which hit $525/MWh, and January forward prices, which hit $475/MWh on Monday. Prices in the CalPX, which operates the state's day-of, day-ahead and block forward electricity market, are likely an indication of the prices the Independent System Operator is paying to secure that out-of-state generation, the CalPX source said. The California ISO, which must ensure the state's grid reliability and operates 75% of the state real-time market, declared a stage-one electrical emergency Monday, meaning operating reserves were below 7%. The ISO said 10,000 MW of power was off line, and issued a call to buy 3,000 MW out of state. It is strange that the CalPX would hit an across-the-board cap in the winter, as opposed to the traditional high-peak summer season, market sources said. The ISO has had an unusual winter, however, having declared an unprecedented five stage-two power emergencies in November due to a large amount of generation off line for planned and unplanned maintenace. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswire; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 04-12-00 2052GMT G_nther A.

Yesterday we entered/moved our exotic deal (deal # 13982.3, which was originally in Short-term Southwest book) into the new Short-term west rockies book and we are seeing a couple of problems: (1) It seems that in DprAutomation the Short-term west rockies book was named as \"ST-WROCK\", rather than \"ST-WR\" (i.e. the book's/roll's name in M:\\common\\power\\Postion\\Dpr\\2001\\0102). Therefore, last night and this morning we had to temparily changed the roll's name to ST-WROCK in order to allow DprAutomation to run through the roll to bring in P&L/PCS/PID data. (After DprAutomation was done running, we then changed it back to ST-WR so we can link the roll to the \"pwrdpr\" file). => We need DprAutomation to use \"ST-WR\" for Short-term west rockies book so we won't have to change the file name everytime we run DprAutomation. (2) As mentioned earlier, yeterday deal #13982.3 's desk was changed from ST-SW to Short-term west rockies in the Exotic book. Although we officialize the Exotic book (post id 14061), Nancy Hernandez in Risk Management (Houston) found that they could not see the Short-term west rockies book officialized in Exotic. => I am not sure if this is due to the same problem as in (1) or something else. We need the new Short-term west rockies book set up right so it can be officialized in the Exotic book in order for the Risk Control Group in Houston to see/monitor it. Please help us look at the above issues. Let me know if I can provide more useful information. (For Nancy: I spoke with Valarie and there is nothing we know of other than deal #13982.3 that was in the ST-SW book in Exotic book.

Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the sky. About 70 degrees. 11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself. 12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us). We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas. AWESOME MOMENT. 12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs. Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the \"Traveler\" and 11 cans of beer into my pants. 1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as \"Cell-Phone Flop Out.\" Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should \"flop out\" his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl.

I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I RULE the pre-game kingdom. 2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy. 2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas. 3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas. Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit.

Subject: Information Request Hello everyone. I know that many, if not all of you, have worked on numerous requests/initiatives from the office of the chair and other teams lately. That being said, we received a new request on Thursday night which is another look at some of the information your groups may have already provided, along with some other information. Attached is a file, with the breakouts and formats as requested by management, containing four (for some of you, five) spreadsheets. Please complete all of these sheets applicable to your business unit (note: dollars in millions). The requested timing of the completion of this exercise is by 3pm Friday, November 15. Please send the completed file back to me as soon as you are finished. If you have any questions about the format or the contents of the file, please contact Michelle Nezi Marvin at 3-6848. For any other questions, please call Mark Lindsey at 3-1873. Thanks, Steve\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

{"subject": "BVI", "body": "I've chartered in the BVI a number of times and it is a great place to take beginners. I only caught your post of yesterday so didn't see the earlier thread. I'm assuming you're picking up the boat in Road Town or nearby. The only problem with getting away from the dock by 12 or so is if the boat isn't quite ready. I've always used the Moorings so they're the only outfit I know. They don't usually let you get started on the boat until after the chart briefing which means you don't go aboard until 10. If you use their provisioning service it eases that chore but sometimes the food isn't there right on time. Having several people (but not too many) around this time is helpful to put food away, take inventory, attend boat briefing, etc. Of course, if you get the boat the day before - maybe with a sleepaboard option or some such, you have that much more certainty that everything will be done on time. Check with your charter company about attending the briefings before sending the last person off to the airport - some companies may require 2 people from your boat to attend. As for first day - if you are away by 1 I suggest heading over to the Bight on Norman Island. There are lots of moorings there and you'll get one as long as you're not in too late. It shouldn't take more than a few hours to get there and if it looks like it might be close you can always fire up the engine. There are a couple of places (a beach bar and a boat) to eat and drink there if you don't feel like cooking the first night and although you can't call it deserted or even secluded because of the number of boats there, there is at least very little ashore to bother you. The caves are just around the corner and the Indians right outside for great snorkeling/diving either that afternoon or first thing the next day. Whether you go clockwise or counterclockwise doesn't really matter. My advice running roughly clockwise: skip Soppers Hole - just a commercial port with little of interest (unless you're clearing customs); skip the USVI - all the clearing out & in & out & in can take a lot of time and there's plenty to do in the BVI - if you just have to go, the northern shore of St. John is the best - nice anchorages (several of the 'secluded' variety) without the crime on St. Thomas and the resort at Caneel Bay will let you come ashore for a fancy dinner (but make reservations and leave your trash on board - there's nowhere to put it); Jost van Dyke is fun - anchor in Great Harbor or pick up a mooring in Little Harbor - Sydney's Peace & Love restaurant in Little Harbor still has an honor bar where you mix your own drinks & just keep track in his little black book while you're waiting for dinner, Foxie's in Great Harbor is a classic beach bar/rest. - lots of fun and good food & drinks; Sandy Cay is everyone's image of a desert island and perfect for a lunch stop and a swim; don't miss Cane Garden Bay (unless the northerly swell is too heavy) there's a wonderful swath of pure white beach with palm trees swaying overhead and steel drum bands serenade you into the evening - watch the reefs but the channel in is well marked; if there's a full moon be sure to be on Tortola somewhere that night (Cane Garden works fine) to get to Bomba's Shack for the party - there are lots of taxis there as the evening progresses to get you back; it's easy to pick people up (or drop them off) at the airport (close to the water with a dinghy dock) midweek if you need to and kind of fun to be met that way; the Baths are a must but VERY crowded (no anchoring allowed - must use a mooring) so I'd try to get there as early in the day as possible (Cooper Island, Marina Cay and area by Last Resort are nearby for the night before) - maybe get up early, motor or sail over and have breakfast once you're safely moored - and be careful to use the right color mooring and avoid the ones reserved for commercial craft; I usually skip Spanish Town (Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor) since I'd rather be at anchor th", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

This is, obviously, not the correct counterparty name. Please correct and send confirmations at your earliest convenience. Derek and George - I have Global Counterparty setting up this new entity in our systems. Please ensure that these trades get moved from BP Capital Energy Equity Fund, L.P. to BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1, L.P. THIS IS CRITICAL. Margin calculations are dependent on these trades being booked correctly. While Mike Larsen has been very accomodating, our margin team can not afford to spend time reconciling trades at the present.

Daily Gas Price Index published : August 22, 2001 CA Power Buying Agency Shops for Natural Gas, Too As part of its 53 long-term electricity contracts, California's Department of Water Resources (DWR) is shopping for a portfolio of natural gas supplies of various duration to use in about half the deals that give the state the option of providing its own fuel supplies when it can beat prevailing market rates used by its power suppliers. So far, it has seven gas deals in various stages of development with six different marketers, according to Sacramento-based DWR spokesperson Oscar Hidalgo. Two contracts are in effect now with Pan-Canadian Energy Services for July and August strips of gas supplies. At this point, DWR will not talk about how much gas and/or electric supplies are involved. \"We have a total of seven 'enabling agreements' that allow us to purchase supplies into the future without re-doing the whole contract process each time,\" Hidalgo said. \"What we have now are two executed contracts with Pan-Canadian for gas. \"It doesn't mean we have to supply gas for the generator (in our long-term contracts), it just means if we can buy gas at a better rate, we have an option to do so. So we're in the early stages of building a gas portfolio that will allow us to bring gas to the deal if it is cost-effective for us to do so.\" DWR is looking at possible storage services as part of its gas deals, said Hidalgo, noting that the state's power-buying agency wants to hedge by having some bulk power deals tied to fixed prices and others using gas tolling arrangements. In addition to the Canadian company, the five other gas marketers with which DWR is talking are: BP Energy Co.; Coast Energy Group; Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc.; Dynegy Marketing and Trade; and Texaco Natural Gas, Inc.", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

I believe that Rod may have a pot at the ETS level. We will need to work with Tracy on this. If you have dollars that you will not spend, though, please let us know.

According to John Reese, another $2,010,921 will hit this year. How are these dollars to be funded? I am assuming that we will be adjusting our CE for the Cooper Pre-Buy dollars, but I would like confirmation on how you would like for us to handle.

I am working with the following assumptions: 1. The 120 monthly spreadsheets will be maintained and updated to the EBB every hour between 6:00 am and 6:00 pm. This is consistent with the historical updating since mid 1998, and I will continue to do this until the new CAS process is tested and released for your group to use(Best guess 2 more month-end nom cycles). 2. The new CAS process will update the EBB with the same data as the spreadsheets. We need to determine if we will include all receipt & delivery points, and if we will include a partial group/path list as we currently post. Currently the spreadsheet contains only those points and/or groups that we thought our shippers might be interested in using monthly. 3. The Gas Control Allocation and Facility Planning unsubscribed modules are adopting new standard group names, I will let you review what those will be prior to any changes to production. 4. The ROFR flag is now in the new CAS and will reduce the unsubscribe numbers past the contract expiration date. This will be effective after CAS is released to you. Currently the 120 monthly spreadsheets tract subscribe FT to the contract expiration date, no reservations past the expiration date. Let me know if my assumptions are correct, and any changes that might effect the above efforts. I need to let the IT group start their development process, as to, What we will post from CAS?

The problem: As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: \"if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate,\" and the additional frustrating language \"[a]ll available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . ..\" At our last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate to index prices. However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals. I have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum rate. Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above. However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language. Why the problem exists (you may already know): Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in the first place. In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a cost-of-service based tariff rates. \"[T]he availability of a recourse service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service. Thus, the recourse rate mitigates market power.\" The Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly not limited to ROFR situations: when capacity is constrained, a shipper willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate. \"When there are more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata basis if required by its tariff.\" The example cited by the Commission: If a pipeline has 100 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a negotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata basis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some other allocation method such as lottery). When TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added the statement that \"if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate.\" Presumably we had concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order to receive negotiated rate authority.

The people have spoken and been counted twice by a computerized process. Now you have fought to pick and select certain counties in which to hand count and \"further allow the people to have a voice\". The voice you want to hear can be created through your legal manipulations, which by the way, you learned well through your boss over these past few years (great job on copying his character, sir). But the genuine voice of the people has already been heard. And since it wasn't the voice YOU wanted to hear, now is being overruled by your political ploys. I have always been so proud of America. I've lived overseas for graduate work and travel frequently overseas for the work I do. But now, sir, I am ashamed. You have shown complete lack of integrity and character. You do not care, sir, about this country. You clearly care much more about your obtaining this office. You do not care, sir, about the voice of the people, but rather that the right voices be heard and all others squelched. I am ashamed of you and find this completely a disgrace to the office you are so bitterly and petulantly fighting for and a disgrace to the nation. Our America was built on integrity, character and honor. You sir, have gutted that foundation. Do you recall the phrase \"God's Country\" -- it still is, sir.

The people have spoken and been counted twice by a computerized process. Now you have fought to pick and select certain counties in which to hand count and \"further allow the people to have a voice\". The voice you want to hear can be created through your legal manipulations, which by the way, you learned well through your boss over these past few years (great job on copying his character, sir). But the genuine voice of the people has already been heard. And since it wasn't the voice YOU wanted to hear, now is being overruled by your political ploys. I have always been so proud of America. I've lived overseas for graduate work and travel frequently overseas for the work I do. But now, sir, I am ashamed. You have shown complete lack of integrity and character. You do not care, sir, about this country. You clearly care much more about your obtaining this office. You do not care, sir, about the voice of the people, but rather that the right voices be heard and all others squelched. I am ashamed of you and find this completely a disgrace to the office you are so bitterly and petulantly fighting for and a disgrace to the nation. Our America was built on integrity, character and honor. You sir, have gutted that foundation. Do you recall the phrase \"God's Country\" -- it still is, sir. And you someday will have to discuss this with Him directly. He also favors truth and justice.

First, be sure to contact the convention hotel and make your reservations. At last count there were only 6 rooms left. Second, I need a completed application form from everyone so that we can get an accurate meal count. I am attaching the program announcement so you can fill out the appropriate boxes for meals and numbers of guests in the event you have not sent in a form. Remember that we are starting the conference off with a luncheon on Friday so plan on arriving early Friday or coming in on Thursday evening if you can. Our hotel is right on the river and there are lots of restaurants and interesting things to visit in the immediate area (the Alamo is across the plaza from the hotel). We are making plans for spouses and children to attend both the dinner on Friday and Saturday evenings. The Friday evening dinner begins at 6 p.m. so that we can be done in plenty of time for our private guided tour of the Alamo at 8:00 p.m. For Saturday we are still working out plans for the evening so stay tuned. There will be more information later as the conference nears. Looking forward to seeing you all and in beautiful, sunny San Antonio. John - announcerev.doc John D. Martin Carr P.

The companies will take a leadership role to facilitate the utilization of Internet technology to enhance service to customers and increase efficiency with suppliers. The electronic marketplace will create a foundation for common industry standards to simplify and accelerate the adoption of electronic commerce across the industry. The marketplace will operate as an independent entity with its own board of directors and management team. Initially, the three founding companies will each have an equal equity position, but it is expected that more partners will join the initiative. Based on demonstrated success, the companies will consider taking the entity public. The paper and forest products industry in the United States ships more than $200 billion worth of products annually. By working together to establish an electronic marketplace, the three leading companies in the industry believe they can benefit customers by simplifying transaction processes, improving information flow and increasing speed of delivery, thereby reducing costs. Providing both procurement and sales functions means the on-line marketplace will also enable participating companies to streamline purchasing operations, reduce inventories, cut internal costs and increase capital efficiency in the industry. The three companies immediately will begin conducting a search for a chief executive officer for the new operation and are assessing potential technology partners to add state-of-the-art expertise to the enterprise. The companies plan to promptly complete a definitive agreement, finalize a business plan and enlist additional strategic partners, including forest products companies and affiliated industry firms. John T. Dillon, International Paper's chairman and chief executive officer, said, \"This is a substantial commitment on the part of three industry leaders to develop a comprehensive electronic marketplace for the forest and paper sector. As manufacturers, marketers and distributors of a broad array of products, we will collectively bring expertise and resources to this effort.\" A.D. \"Pete\" Correll, Georgia-Pacific's chairman and chief executive officer, said, \"This is a bold move for the paper and forest products industry.

SportsLine.com has learned that Jaguars running back Fred Taylor met with the specialist Tuesday morning and was told that his injured groin is still not healed. Taylor has been practicing the past three weeks and the Jaguars had hoped he would have been back in the lineup already. However, he has been unable to run full speed and now comes word that he will continue be sidelined. \"Dr. Uribe said he has a major injury and that after eight weeks, it's still not healed and is going to take some more time getting healthy,\" Taylor's agent Drew Rosenhaus said. \"He wasn't sure specifically how much time Fred would miss but it's a major tear, he tore the groin muscle off the bone. Dr. Uribe said this is the type of injury that could often take a minimum of three months before it is healed.\" Taylor injured the groin in the first half of the team's second game of the year. He made a cut in the middle of the field and suddenly stopped, let go of the ball and dropped. \"It's going to be very unfair for anyone to assume he will play any time in the immediate future,\" said Rosenhaus. \"He's just not healthy yet. He can't run full speed without tremendous pain. The Jaguars have done a very good job in working him but he's still in pain. \"It's not just the groin but he also has pain in the hip now, which is an off-shoot of the groin. But he's still healing and he shouldn't play at this time and when the Jaguars talk to him later today, I'm sure they'll have the same feeling.\" In Taylor's absence, the Jaguars have played musical chairs in the backfield. Stacey Mack has been the primary replacement, but youngsters Frank Moreau and Elvis Joseph have also been given shots. Mack started Sunday's game and will likely remain with the first team in the immediate future. \"He's doing everything he can to get back in as soon as possible,\" said the Florida-based agent. \"Remember, we entered the season primed to play and receive a big contract extension so nobody wants in there more than Fred. \"But the doctor recommends that he is progressing at a good pace and it depends on how the injury heals. He said he has seen guys miss an entire season with this. But at the same time, it's such a vague injury. Fred may wake up next week and suddenly feel great. At the same time, it could take several weeks. We don't know. We only know he's healing but shouldn't play at this time.\" [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ OUR VIEW ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] This makes sense as the Jaguars have been very vague about Taylor's health. Clearly, bad news for Taylor owners. Stacey Mack and Elvis Joseph get an extension but they've come up pretty small so far. As Dr. Coshal, our Footballguys.com Team Doc mentioned way back when Taylor was injured, this is a serious deal. Stay tuned but for now it's not looking good.

These will be Category 2 seating which I've been guaranteed is great. It seems that Category 1 seating has been scooped up by season ticket holders and other groups that also had early purchase opportunities - BMC alone is ordering over 500 tickets for its employees with our 23 tickets included in that number. Anyway, these tickets are $50 instead of $60 so those of you who have already put your checks in the mail will get a refund from me at some point. In the meantime, we can all mark up our calendars for the 19th of January.

As the state's booming economy taxes the ability to meet electricity demands, a federal investigation is underway. CHRIS KRAUL TIMES STAFF WRITER Aug. 28, 2000 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page A-1 Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company With Southern Californians reeling from skyrocketing electric bills, critics charge that fewer than a dozen power suppliers are reaping far greater profits than are justified by the recent surge in wholesale prices of the natural gas they use to create electricity. Their behavior is a major focus of a formal investigation announced last week by federal regulators. Among those under scrutiny are power merchants including <B>Duke</B> <B>Energy</B>, <B>Dynegy</B>, <B>Reliant</B> <B>Energy</B>, Calpine, Southern Co. and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Critics say the companies are earning huge windfalls selling energy to the two state agencies charged with distributing power in California. The power merchants themselves deny any profiteering, describing their market moves as legal business practices and welcoming the investigation. The underlying cause of California's energy turmoil is a severe shortage of power-generating capacity to meet the soaring energy demands of the state's booming economy. This summer the state at times has had to import more than 20% of its energy needs, a shortfall equal to the output of about 20 medium-size power plants. No plants of any size have been built in the state in 10 years. But the problem goes beyond a supply-and-demand imbalance. The so-called merchant power companies' ability to bend the market to their advantage--using what appear to be legal strategies--illustrates what many say are serious flaws in the state's deregulated energy market. One major flaw is that sellers do not have to participate in the state's main electricity auction--the so-called \"day forward\" sale held one day before electricity is delivered to the state's residences and businesses. Instead, generators are withholding power until the day of delivery, when desperate state agencies are willing to pay steep prices to keep the power flowing. The upshot has been a doubling of electric bills for the 1.2 million customers in San Diego Gas&Electric's coverage area, and Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas&Electric customers may be facing higher prices once their rates are unfrozen in 2002. There is little prospect for short-term relief; with no additional power generation due for a year, the prices of natural gas and crude oil are still rising. In fact, state officials expect the market to become tighter over the next year as demand and fuel prices rise. In pointing the finger at the power merchants, Gov. Gray Davis, some academics and utility executives charge that California consumers are being victimized by sophisticated trading techniques that take advantage of the market system to extract huge profits.

{"subject": "Re: EOL Stationery", "body": "Dear Justin, Have spoken with Dave Minns just now and I think he is going to spk with you. I don't think I have been clear enough and I am sorry. We here at Enron Japan have no particular desire (or resources at the moment) to send out EOL related correspondence from here. If, however, EOL decides it is better for EOL related correspondence with Japanese counterparties to go from Enron Japan Corp. (as the legal entity responsible for the content of a letter) rather than any other Enron entity, then we will have to review and sign the correspondence (since it will create legal obligations for us) or have someone else sign pursuant to a limited power of attorney. If you want the letters to go from Enron Japan Corp. and for the EOL logo to be on the paper then we would also need to consider whether we (EJ) needed to register the logo as a business / trade name here. I am not sure whether this has been done. (Also note that at the moment although the Japanese version of the letterhead refers to \"Enron Japan Corp.\", the English translation says \"EnronOnLine\". In any case these should be consistent I would think. On the other hand, if the correspondence can go from EOL LLC, or another Enron legal entity then we do not need to be involved and I think this would be our preference. I know that the Enron Metals people here are trying to convert their customers over to EOL. The EJ traders are also trying to sell EOL in the market. The time therefore may come when we prefer to \"personalize\" our EOL dealings by having them sent from EJ or Enron Metals out of Tokyo but I don't think that time has quite come yet. As a separate issue, if EOL wants to use the Enron Japan address in Tokyo on its letters to Japanese counterparties, it may have to register a branch and this may have unexpected tax implications for EOL LLC.

My voicemail was full on Monday - when I checked in with Keegan on Monday late morningshe advised me of such and I deleted the calls periodically. I do realize that I do get a lot of calls and emails due to the 50 or so brokerage related agreements & the numerous deals I am working on so I do try to clear the box daily. (2) I can be of more assistance in the future if, instead of telling Keegan you need a file, that you contact me directly. That way, I can make sure that you get what you need. I took a lot of Enron calls and faxes while on vacation so I would not have objected had you contacted me directly. That way we do not have to put the burden on Keegan to locate my files -- although I am sure she is more than willing to help, I do not think she knows much about where I keep particular files or documents. (3) Also with respect to Keegan, I wanted to relay to you that she felt uncomfortable being quizzed by you or passing judgment as to why I have chosen to receive orthodontal treatment in New York rather than in Houston. (The answer to the question is irrelevant. If I were getting treatment across the street from the office, I still could be here to do any work. My getting the treatment in New York, while I am on vacation, does not affect my presence in the office or undermine in any way my ability to do my job). Equally important, apparently these were not fair questions of Keegan, as she has informed me that they made her feel uncomfortable and she only answered because she sensed or thought she was obligated to do so. Nor do I think they are fair of me. I do not wish to justify my medical decisions with my colleagues, especially provided that I am taking vacation time or sick time I rightfully can take.

Nor do I think they are fair of me. I do not wish to justify my medical decisions with my colleagues, especially provided that I am taking vacation time or sick time I rightfully can take. It was previously represented to me that our department policy is that when out for medical reasons, we should provide in an email or otherwise convey a general statement - the details are not required. If that is not the policy then please advise. In any case, if for some justifiable reason you have to know such information and you need to rely on it, it is best to ask me directly so that you can be sure that the information you are getting is accurate.

{"subject": "glom: M-W's Word of the Day", "body": "*************************************************************** Did you know Julius Caesar moved January to the head of the year? Click here for your guide to word histories. http://www.m-w.com/book/literead/wordhist.htm *************************************************************** The Word of the Day for January 8 is: glom \\GLAHM\\ (verb) *1 : take, steal 2 : seize, catch Example sentence: \"Nobody needs to glom my favorite hairbrush anymore,\" Liz told her three teenage daughters, \"now that I've bought each of you one just like it.\" Did you know? It's a classic case of glomming.

Looks like the only thing that is going to happen will be a Budget without anything on energy restructuring (could continue to change). There will be some additional negotiating on SBX2 78 over the recess. Enron is looking for a way into those discussions (Jeff Dasovich). We will try to push good language on DA dates and assignment of Utility and CDWR costs. On another note, CDWR has announced its revenue requirements going forward. The numbers are significantly less than had previously been expected (due to lower costs for spot market purchases). The end result, if their figures are correct, is that the March 27 3c/kwh increase would be sufficient going forward (we are trying to validate). The key is that now the Retained Generation proceedings will determine if any more $ is needed from retail customers.

This largely represents TURN's proposal. The Senate also passed a budget and has since adjourned until August 20. The Assembly had been considering two MOUs, ABX 82 (Keeley) and ABX 50 (Wright). Both bills had difficulty attracting a majority of votes given their different approaches to dealing with SCE. ABX 82 for example, had large users picking up most of the tab for SCE's undercollection whereas ABX 50 split those charges among all users. Both bills provided for some type of direct access and ABX 82 also provided for a purchase of the transmission system. In light of the difficulty in passing either bill, it appears as if the Assembly will shelve both proposals today in order to amend SBX 78 over the summer break. An internal legislative working group may be formed to draft amendments but this has not been confirmed. Large users have begun drafting extensive am\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

{"subject": "Alternative work schedule status", "body": "As you might already know we had to reschedule our second meeting that was scheduled for Wednesday 2/16 to Tuesday 2/22 in room 3013. Lunch will be provided. I apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future. I was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we know are needed in our work hours. Here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting: Schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss at the next meeting. Each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting Bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow up with HR on schedules being used at Enron The following is what I heard at the first meeting: Our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that would more or less guarantee (other than maybe an occasional call) you have the weekend off. Cross-training seemed to be the key here. Some desks seemed to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels. Cross-training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a \"just do it\" attitude. There doesn't have to be an across the board solution for Logistics. However all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk changes. Late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders willingness to do deals at any time.

DF From: Bob Chandler 06/29/2000 10:26 AM To: Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc: Rod Hayslett/FGT/Enron@Enron, Allison Millan/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Elaine Concklin/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Bill Cordes/ET&S/Enron@ENRON Subject: ET&S 2nd Quarter Earnings As you know we have been developing a list of possible earnings items to be moved out of 2nd quarter. The list now totals $7.5MM and has been approved by Stan and Rod. We're now in the \"make it happen\" stage. We have 3 items that we'll need your assistance with: Increasing the Conoco litigation reserve from $1.0mm that we now have on the books to a new balance of $3.0MM -- a $2MM increase. To accomplish this we need a memo from you to request and support the increase. The fact that we laid $3MM cash on the settlement table is good. It you mention that it was $3MM plus Hobbs 12\" line, then please qualify that with an indication that the market value of that line is de minimus. Increasing the accrual for the Duke/Coyanosa obligation from $600,000 to $800,000. I'm not sure what the basis for this increase is (continuing cost incurrence?), but your help in supporting the increase is solicited. Need a copy of the SBA Transaction Fee agreement with TransCanada Energy Marketing so that we can accrue (and expense) the obligation in June (assuming it's not payable until July). As we discussed earlier this week, we also need this document for AA's final review of base gas sale documents.\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

CC list suppressed... December 13, 2000 Energy Price Volatility May Hurt Utilities' Credit By REBECCA SMITH Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Recent volatility in wholesale energy markets is undermining the credit ratings and may eventually crimp the borrowing ability of some of the nation's biggest utilities, long regarded in the credit markets as some of the safest bets around. It is the worst out West, where the price of power to be delivered Wednesday hit a new high of $1,182 per megawatt hour on California's state-sanctioned auction, a benchmark for the entire region. That compares with $30 a year ago. But even utilities in the East, such as GPU Inc. of Parsippany, N.J., and Consolidated Edison of New York, also are at risk because they are paying higher prices than ever for spot-market electricity purchases and aren't always able to pass along that cost to their customers. As an indication of just how bad things are getting, Moody's Investors Service Tuesday put Seattle City Light on \"negative outlook,\" even though it is one of the lowest-cost generators in the nation. There hasn't been much rain in the Northwest this year and the city-owned utility has been forced to go to the wholesale market this month to buy 100 to 200 megawatts of electricity each day. That isn't much energy, but with prices that have gone as high as $1,000 per megawatt hour this week, compared with the $24 per megawatt hour that the municipal utility pays for power from the federal hydroelectric system, costs add up fast. The utility, which issued $100 million in bonds this week, is raising rates 10%, effective Jan. 1, and will keep the rate increase in effect as long as it takes to dig its way out. \"Prices are at absurd levels,\" says Seattle City Light Superintendent Gary Zarker. \"I know others are looking at significant rate increases too.\" Credit-rating agencies say they are going through their utility portfolios and separating those with exposure to wholesale markets from those that have enough in-house generation to meet customer demand. Then they are trying to figure out which of the ones that are forced to buy on the spot market will be allowed to pass on higher costs and which ones won't. \"You have the makings of a credit crunch when utilities are required to buy power but aren't allowed to pass the cost through,\" says Steven Fetter, managing director of the global power unit at Fitch, the New York credit-rating agency. That is exactly the position California's biggest investor-owned utilities are in. Southern California Edison Co., a unit of Edison International, and Pacific Gas and Electric Co., a unit of PG&E Corp., have incurred deficits in excess of $7 billion buying power on the open market since June and were forced to pay higher rates and offer unprecedented guarantees to investors when they last issued bonds. While they are still making money from the power plants they own, it is nowhere near enough to make up for the shortfall. Credit ratings of both utilities were lowered this week. Blown the Lid Off There is no cost relief in sight. California's grid operator last week lifted a price cap for power it buys each hour to keep supply matched with demand. That helped reliability because more generators came forward and offered energy through an orderly market, instead of waiting for harried engineers to call them at the last minute trying to strike a deal. But it has really blown the lid off prices in the West.

It should be noted that a vote is pending in the Argentine Congress (had been expected today) to adjust the convertibility law in Argentina to allow a basket of euros and U.S. dollars in equal weights (once parity is reached for euro-dollar) that would replace the existing one-for-one peso to US dollar currency board. The economy ministry took a first step toward this new basket regime by introducing this week a dual-exchange rate system for the traded sector that allows Argentine exporters to benefit from the weaker euro by receiving export earnings in line with a mixed basket of 50% euros and 50% US dollars. At today's spot rates, this implies an 8% depreciation of the peso vis-a-vis the basket. An 8% devaluation at this juncture does not gain the kind of competitiveness needed by Argentine exporters to help boost economy when a major trading partner, Brazil, has depreciated 21% vis-a-vis the USD since the beginning of this year. Initial reports indicate that consumer and corporate borrowers, however, would still pay debt service at the dollar peg exchange rate (one-for-one).

Last year there were about 100 delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk management for the energy sector. The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around using our software. This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

The subject could be: * a general energy risk related topic * a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in the energy markets * your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation, food and drink.

Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission. Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors. New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming. In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses. All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation. Pre-Petition Expenses We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000. We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000. However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses. This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel. We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses. We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000. Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap. Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.

{"subject": "Tenaska IV 11/00", "body": "I am having trouble with the transport deal for the Tenaska IV contracts on Lone Star. We have deal 452491 in Sitara for meter 20014804 at a $0.01 transport rate. We received the statement from TXU Lone Star and it does not agree with our deal. They are billing for meter 25000200 at $0.10 and meter 20014903 at $0.02. These meters relate to the Tenaska IV sale deal 384258 and the Tenaska Marketing deal 459898, respectively. Should our deal match what TXU is billing or is there another deal that I am missing? I haven't worked with transport very much, so I could be confused. I think we have this problem with Oct 2000, also, but I have not reviewed it yet. I am going to look at it this afternoon. Tenaska IV has already reimbursed us for the TXU transport, so we will need to pay this next week. Also, now that we have the actuals for Nov 2000, we need to update the demand fees to reflect the correct volumes.

They are billing for meter 25000200 at $0.10 and meter 20014903 at $0.02. These meters relate to the Tenaska IV sale deal 384258 and the Tenaska Marketing deal 459898, respectively. Should our deal match what TXU is billing or is there another deal that I am missing? I haven't worked with transport very much, so I could be confused. I think we have this problem with Oct 2000, also, but I have not reviewed it yet. I am going to look at it this afternoon. Tenaska IV has already reimbursed us for the TXU transport, so we will need to pay this next week.

{"subject": "Time Magazine - Enron Plays the Pipes....", "body": "This article is forwarded to you per Mark Palmer's request... Business Enron Plays The Pipes This old-time gas company is trading fuel for a future as a new-economy superpower. Will the swap work? Frank Gibney Jr./Houston 08/28/2000 Time Magazine Time Inc. 38+ (Copyright 2000) It's Saturday night, and the only thing between you and a movie from Blockbuster Video is the unpaid late fee for last week's rental. If that sounds familiar, then you'll appreciate this: next year Blockbuster plans to offer up to 500 movie titles online in more than a dozen major cities around the U.S. That's right, video on demand (not the frustrating no-rewind, no-pause pay-per-view offerings of today) for anyone with a DSL line at home. What's remarkable is that Blockbuster's partner happens to be an energy company called Enron. At a time when so many old-economy companies seem helpless against the dizzying pace and technology of the digital age, Enron is demonstrating why FORTUNE magazine keeps voting it the most innovative large company in America. For years the Houston-based firm simply produced, transported and marketed natural gas. Then, as energy deregulation threatened profit margins in the gas business, Enron discovered it could make billions by trading and brokering packages of energy the way Midwesterners do pork bellies. Now Enron is moving into the telecommunications business, with a national fiber-optic cable network and a floor bulging with Sun supercomputers. In fact, Enron may be the most interesting old-economy company around. Since moving its trading operations from the phone to the Web eight months ago, the company has doubled revenues to more than $30 billion. Most of that is made through trading everything from energy and paper to weather risk derivatives and now bandwidth--more than 800 offerings in all. Think of eBay, but instead of auctioning $5 used Baby Gap pajamas, the company trades $600,000 blocks of natural gas--and pockets commensurately huge commissions. Boasts Enron president Jeffrey Skilling: \"In terms of dollars transacted, we're the world's largest online site by a factor of 10.\" So far this year, that has meant $120 billion in transactions. And when you're running the network, all sorts of profitable opportunities arise. Last week, when word spread that natural-gas prices would spike this winter, Enron's in-house traders saw their gains surge as customers raced to lock in future supplies at today's prices. And Enron's stock price? It hit $90 last week, tripling its value of a year ago. Kind of like an Internet play, only better. The market loves Enron because Skilling and CEO Kenneth Lay seem to have come up with a business model that works for just about anything. They provide a service to their customers by packaging a supply of name your commodity and then using the efficiency of their vast network to beat most prices. They arrived at this model back in the mid-1980s almost out of desperation, when crude-oil prices had collapsed, natural-gas deregulation had thrown that market into chaos, and the Peruvian government had just nationalized Enron's offshore properties. Figuring they might as well leverage deregulation instead of succumbing to it--call it business judo-- Skilling, a McKinsey & Co. consultant at the time, came up with a plan called the Gas Bank, to buy up reserves of natural gas, then package them for sale, with various prices and conditions for different customers. When electricity markets deregulated a few years ago, the company did the same. It's the oldest concept in business: buy low, sell high. Enron also leverages its assets and expertise to provide services to big customers. Since 1997, companies like Owens Corning and Chase Manhattan Bank have signed long-term, multibillion-dollar contracts with Enron subsidiary Enron Energy Services (EES) that lock in their energy costs for up to 10 years and provide Enron with a steady revenue stream.

In addition, EFM completed 199 intermodal transactions in the first week of April. ENA West Power ENA West Power recently closed the sale of two power projects. The 750MW Pastoria Energy Facility in Kern County, California was sold to Calpine and the 240MW Fountain Valley Power project in Colorado was sold to Black Hills Energy Capital. Given the power shortage in the West, ENA is developing additional power generation in Nevada, California and Washington. Enron Industrial Markets The newsprint group of EIM is working to revolutionize the newsprint market and bring financial rigor and market efficiencies to a business that has remained relatively unchanged for more than a century. The global newsprint market is a 23 billion dollar a year business with the North American market comprising one third. The group's originators, mid-marketers, and financial and physical traders offer our customers numerous financial and physical products not previously available in the market. EIM has made a substantial commitment to this business with the purchase of Garden State Paper company last year and the recent purchase of Daishowa Paper in Quebec City. The number of transactions has grown exponentially with the physical trading alone reaching a nominal trading volume of more than $10,000,000 per month in little more than four months since opening. In addition to physical spot transactions, the desk offers our counterparties log-term fixed priced transactions, indexed based pricing, forward contracts, swaps, and derivative products. Forest Products Forestweb Inc., an Internet-based generator, aggregator and integrator of knowledge and information for the forest products industry, announced a new window to industry financial and risk management tools available from Clickpaper.com. Clickpaper allows the industry direct access to transactable prices for both physical and financial products, in an electronic format.

If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1. Examine LDC's incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. This creates a shortage in later months. 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. Specific questions should include: 1. Why in March '00-May '00 weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system. I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating rate. This market has been long historically. It has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted. Call me if you need any more input.

At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to change MG's status. Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK \"arranger\" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical solutions: 1. Contractual entity - either Enron North America, MG London Inc or Newco Inc. 2. Arranger - either EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd or MG Brokers Ltd (depending on the effect on their chapter 3 status for the last two). The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK and Switzerland. Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If you need any further information, please let me know.

{"subject": "the midterm", "body": "David Levine BA E201B Macroeconomics Fun Midterm The figure in [brackets] indicates the points and the suggested time for that question. The exam is designed to take 70 minutes, but you have 80 minutes to complete it. (To be honest, 50 minutes should suffice.) PLEASE KEEP WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT. Be sure to write the starting and ending times on the exam you turn in. The exam is closed book. If you are turning in a written copy, please write on only one side of a page, and if your handwriting is as bad as mine, please skip lines. Label all diagrams clearly. If you are writing on a PC, feel free to place diagrams on a separate paper. I) False, or Uncertain, and Why? The grade you receive depends solely on the quality of your explanation. If you are not sure of what the question assumes, simply state your own assumptions clearly, and answer based on these assumptions. Most of the answers should be fairly brief. When in doubt, state your assumptions (classical vs. Keynesian, long- vs. short-run,...). Answers in this section should typically be two paragraphs, or one paragraph and some bullet points. Avoid one-word answers or bullets. 1. [10] The government should promote a higher rate of saving to increase output in the long run. 2. [10] Productivity has risen in recent years in the United States because many new workers have joined the labor force to take advantage of the booming economy. 3. [10] An unexpected fall in inflation hurts lenders since the nominal value of the payments they receive is reduced. II) Longer answers 4. [20] Illustrate the effects of the recent decision by the European Central Bank to alter its monetary policy using the ISLM diagram. If European output is currently below the level associated with NAIRU, is their decision correct? Explain. 5.

{"subject": "ENA Meeting and Event Expenditure Approval Process", "body": "The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money. These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows. ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo. The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events. However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval. Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events. 1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman 2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events. Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and ENA. 3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event. Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval. Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form. 4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of the Chairman for final approval. Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts. If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

I know that Sue Mara spoke with Ron on this subject also, although I was not on the call. The matter was not discussed on our Western Wholesale call this morning either, since I did not become aware of it till later. I would therefore like to receive input from Sue and others on our team about this, getting final sign off to proceed from Linda Robertson and Jim Steffes. If we elect to proceed, it would be appropriate to bill all participating marketers in equal shares. Thanks.

The Research Group is actively involved in this effort which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic optimization and stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

We are inviting Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon to this meeting. We would appreciate if you could speak, together with Kevin and Ken, on strategic directions of EBS.

We hope that with this new influx of talent we will continue to \"raise the bar\" for IT support of Enron's trading activities in Portland. Richard Schweiger is our new Senior Applications Specialist. He comes to Enron through RHI Consulting where he contracted at Enron for the last 2 months and has now converted to full-time. Richard has several years of Visual Basic and C++ programming experience. He has been living in the Portland, Oregon area for the past 4 years and is originally from California. His current projects include migration of the California Pre-Trade application to the intranet as well as building strong middle tier architecture to support the new CAL-Web development. Michael Tully is our new lead Trading Floor Support analyst. He recently moved from Oklahoma where he was the Lead Help Desk Support for Electronic Storage Corporation. Mike's wife is due with their second baby in January. Outside of work, Mike love's to scuba dive. Mike is currently working for Comsys and hopes to eventually convert to full-time. Mike is replacing Wendella Rhoads who recently moved back to Eugene to be closer to family. Dan Maxwell is a new contract developer from Maxim consulting working on the California Pre-Trading application. Dan currently lives in Boise, Idaho and commutes to Portland during the week. Dan spent the previous year commuting to Washington DC developing software for GEICO insurance company. He is originally from Miami, Florida where the beach is the place to be but counting is a lost art. Paul Kane has recently transferred from the IT infrastructure group to the IT applications group to work on SQL support and development. On a sadder note, we will be losing Winston Goodbody on December 18th to a six month cross-country skiing trek across Wyoming. Winston has been contracting at Enron for the last year and a half and will be sorely missed.

Transportation Agreements CGT-IT agreement #41828 - I'm assuming this is the agreement used to get gas to GELP--is Duke or CES agent on this? Commonwealth Gas Services - same question as CGT IT agreement Note: According to the billing calculations, it appears that the Duke supply arrangement must have some FT transport--whose name is that in? Other Contracts Transco - to be acquired - Is there an IT agreement on Transco that is used? If so, we need contract # and is someone agent on the transport? Also, in the GELP agreement you indicated that you get real time meter information from a Bristol RTU. How will ENA get this meter information? Also, just in general--could you explain your perspective on the value proposition in this agreement? I understand that there is a $5000 fee you receive each month that accompanies alot of reporting responsibilities. Since the data you provided for last year showed very little gas deliveries in the \"winter period\" (where you would receive $.05/MMBtu additional compensation), there doesn't seem to be much up side value there.

Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are appropriate to hit the net ENA target. In order to stay flat year on year, I split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups. As we had discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the accountability managed by each of you. All outside variable costs, specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc. I look at this cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business and evaluate/manage our risks. Wes, can you please finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for each group with these changes.

I don't normally like to pass these on but it has too much importance. Even if your a skeptic read to the bottom. Did you know that it's Beautiful Women Month? Well, it is and that means you. There are 3 billion women who don't look like supermodels . . .and only eight who do. Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14. If Barbie was a real woman, she'd have to walk on all fours due to her proportions. The average woman weighs 144 lbs and wears between a 9-14. One out of every four college aged women has an eating disorder. The models in the magazines are airbrushed -- not perfect! A psychological study in 1995 found that three minutes spent looking at a fashion magazine caused 70% of women to feel depressed, guilty, and shameful. Models twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman. Today they weigh 23% less. ***** Beauty of a Woman - The beauty of a woman Is not in the clothes she wears, The figure she carries Or the way she combs her hair. The beauty of a woman Must be seen from her eyes, Because that is the doorway to her heart, The place where love resides. The beauty of a woman Is not in a facial mole, But true beauty in a woman Is reflected in her soul. It is the caring that she lovingly gives The passion that she shows, The beauty of a woman With passing years - only grows. ***** An English professor wrote the words, \"Woman without her man is nothing,\" on the blackboard and directed the students to punctuate it correctly. The men wrote: \"Woman, without her man, is nothing.\" The women wrote: \"Woman! Without her, man is nothing.\" ***** The Images of Mother - 4 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mommy can do anything! 8 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mom knows a lot! A whole lot! 12 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mother doesn't really know quite everything. 14 YEARS OF AGE ~ Naturally, Mother doesn't know that, either. 16 YEARS OF AGE ~ Mother? She's hopelessly old-fashioned. 18 YEARS OF AGE ~ That old woman? She's way out of date! 25 YEARS OF AGE ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it. 35 YEARS OF AGE ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion. 45 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about it? 65 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.

{"subject": "Jeff McMahon Named CFO", "body": "Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer. In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.

Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price. I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around. Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process. But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.

Take the Banner Concepts survey at http://www.rresults.com/bannerconcept/index.cgi _____________________________________________________________ Today's focus: Intrusion detection systems By Neal Weinberg Intrusion detection systems are key components to any security system. So the Reviewmeister decided to check out network-based IDS products from Cisco, Computer Associates, Enterasys Networks, Intrusion.com and Internet Security Systems (ISS). The intrusion detection systems (IDS) products from Cisco, Enterasys and Intrusion.com are appliances, while CA and ISS offer software-based systems. We conducted several tests to measure performance. First, we measured how well the product could detect a random sample of commonly recognized intrusion attacks, such as ping floods, Jolt2 attacks, SYN floods, finger bombs and others. These were tested initially under no background traffic load. To achieve a passing score, the IDS had to correctly identify the attack within five minutes of the attack's launch. We tallied whether the intrusion was recorded, if it was correctly identified and the approximate time it took to recognize the attack. Next, we ran stress tests to see how the products would work as background traffic load increased from 40M to 60M bit/sec, then up to 90M bit/sec. A third test determined whether the products could detect attacks specifically designed to avoid traditional IDS systems. Enterasys' IDS Dragon took the gold in performance. In addition to its excellent showing in the first two tests, Dragon also beat the competition by detecting attacks that are specifically designed to avoid traditional IDS systems. IDS Dragon also performed with near bulletproof reliability, demonstrating minimal performance degradation under traffic load and solid system stability during all of the tests. The IDS Dragon missed only three out of 27 random attacks and detected 24 out of the resulting 24 attacks sent to it under the 40M and 60M bit/sec traffic load. With the 90M bit/sec traffic, IDS Dragon correctly detected 21 out of 24 attacks. No other product performed as well with the basic intrusion- detection and stress tests, although Cisco Secure IDS performed well under load. The ISS RealSecure performed well under 40M and 60M bit/sec loads, detecting 22 out of 24 attacks, but fell down to 17 attacks out of 24 when the traffic load went to 90M bit/sec. Intrusion.com's SecureNet Pro had the hardest time under heavy background traffic loads. After a strong start - detecting 24 out of 27 attacks with no load - performance steadily declined as load increased. It detected only four out of 27 attacks under the 90M bit/sec load. Curiously, SecureNet detected the highest number of attacks (25) under no load, but supported the smallest database of known attack signatures of the products tested. All the products tested did well in detecting certain attacks, including Whisker (various types), Targa3 and Bind, which are specifically designed to evade network-based IDS products. Cisco, CA, Enterasys and Intrusion.com detected 16 out of 17 attacks, and ISS got them all. While CA's eTrust IDS performed adequately in our stress tests, it did not perform consistently under high (90M bit/sec) loads. It appeared that the longer we let the background traffic stream run (up to 10 minutes or more), the less consistently eTrust detected the attacks.

I think there are still some minor issues that we should discuss, but they should not get in the way of release.

Edison stated that it would fight any U.S. court decision in favor of Caithness, which could come as early as tomorrow. -Because of their dire financial situation, we believe that QFs like Caithness pose the greatest risk of filing an involuntary bankruptcy petition against PG&E and Edison International. -Last week, state legislators modified SB47X, the draft bill to lower QF prices, in an effort to speed its passage. Reportedly, legislators are trying to lower average QF prices to $0.079 per kWh. The CPUC is unlikely to decide on revenue allocation until the bill is passed. -This week, California moved forward with demand- and supply-side programs, including the governor\u0001,s plan to give a 20% rebate to customers that reduce power consumption by 20%. Also, three Western governors made another request to FERC to cap wholesale prices. -Although Governor Davis and the utilities continue to negotiate a utility recovery plan, it is unclear if the state legislature will pass such a plan. Therefore, we suggest that investors avoid EIX ($14.88, Hold) and PCG ($14.24, Hold), unless they have a high tolerance for risk and volatility. Please call us with any questions you may have.

Hi Everyone, Well, it's official. I am finally making the final arrangements for my move to London! I leave Friday, July 14th, but before I go I would like to throw a going away bash. It's been awhile since we've all been out together so I hope you can make it. I am sure that I have forgotten people, so please forward the email on. The festivities will commence at my apartment next Friday, July 7th....at my apartment. I'll be providing beer and wine but feel free to bring your favorite beverage. I live a block away from the Galant Knight...if you can't make it to the apartment, meet up with us at the Galant Knight on Holcombe. I live at 7777 Greenbriar #3056. My gate code is 284. If you need directions, leave me a message on my voice mail and I'll call you back...since I will out on vacation for most of next week. I hope to see you all! Carrie\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

{"subject": "California Schedules", "body": "Group, When doing an import or an export from California there are a few important guidelines to remember. IMPORT-This must be FIRM. A firm import is required so that we provide the spinning reserves to California (we do this by buying firm energy for the import).

A non-firm export allows us to provide spinning reserves to our bilat trading partners (or to simply sell the energy without spinning reserves as \"non-firm\"), and NOT have to pay the California price for spinning reserve margins. Conversely if we do a firm export, we would have to pay for California to supply spinning reserves. And because California will sometime use actual purchased energy for spinning reserves, this could easily be $400 per mw this summer. California has also proposed cutting firm exports this summer, so a \"firm\" export does not imply that the energy would actually be exported anymore than nonfirm. IF you have other questions.

The short answer is that Nora Dobin in Global Finance legal will be your contact person on everything other than the swap. Mark Taylor (or his designee) will handle the swap. We will rely heavily on Ron Astin and Trena Chandler of V&E to assist us on the Whitewing issues.

As a brief description of the Margaux transaction, in case you have not been updated recently, the Margaux transaction will now occur through the synthetic transfer of risk to the Noteholders/Margaux equity. The method by which this occurs is as follows. Whitewing continues to hold the equity interests in the assets (excluding 56% of Trakya, ETOL, approx. 31.25% of Sutton Bridge, 50% of Nowa Sarzyna, and approx. 50% of Teesside, all of which are held by Enron). Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with ENA, with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount representing the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making a floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment from Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things happen at the various projects (thereby transferring certain of the risks of the projects through the floating leg). Concurrently, Margaux (the Issuer) raises approx. $511 mm of capital and, through a whollly-owned subsidiary, purchases the floating leg (receiveable) from Whitewing for $511 MM. In other words, Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its receiveable to Margaux. The net result is that Whitewing receives cash proceeds up front, and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA, and ENA has a floating payment obligation to Margaux. I've attached a structure diagram below. With this in mind, the following issues related to Whitewing have arisen. The tax group would like to characterize the payment ENA receives from Whitewing as a preferred partnership distribution (see attached note from Donette Dewar below). My question is how do we achieve this result. First, is Whitewing LP able to enter into this transaction itself, or does it need to occur at a subsidiary level? In other words, does the swap fall under the definition of \"Indebtedness\" (clause (viii) perhaps?) in the Whitewing LP Agreement, which is prohibited at the Whitewing level?

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research. The students and faculty members from the business school will be also invited. Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research in particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets (S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein). My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall also have an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many questions) before many experts who are very important to shaping public opinion and regulatory agenda. Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this presentation and in presenting Enron's point of view in a more effective way. Vince FYI. The name of my friend who invited me: Shmuel S. Oren, Professor Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research 4117 Etcheverry Hall University of California Berkeley, CA 94720-1777\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

At issue is the ranking of managers, professionals and sometimes lower-level employees from best to worst, or grading them on a bell curve, and then using that ranking to help determine pay and sometimes whether to fire someone. In their suits, all filed over the last year or so, employees at Microsoft, Ford Motor and Conoco say the rating systems are unfair because they favor some groups of employees over others: white males over blacks and women, younger managers over older ones and foreign citizens over Americans. A growing number of companies are turning to grading systems, also known as forced rankings or distributions, as a way of making sure managers evaluate employees honestly and make clearer distinctions among them. At companies that do not compare employees with one another this way, nearly every employee can come away feeling above average, like the children of Lake Wobegon. But under the grading system, managers are forced to identify some people as low performers. At General Electric, for example, supervisors identify the top 20 percent and bottom 10 percent of their managerial and professional employees every year. The bottom 10 percent are not likely to stay. As John F. Welch Jr., General Electric's chief executive, wrote last month to shareholders, \"A company that bets its future on its people must remove that lower 10 percent, and keep removing it every year \u0001* always raising the bar of performance and increasing the quality of its leadership.\" Ranking or grading employees is also common at technology companies like Cisco Systems and Hewlett- Packard. But recently the concept has been catching on more broadly, according to management consultants. One reason is that as the economy slows, companies often lay off employees. Cisco, for example, announced earlier this month that it would let go as many as 5,000 workers \u0001* and would use grading as one way to identify people to lay off. \"Companies are playing their version of `Survivor,' \" said David Thomas, a professor at the Harvard Business School. Another reason is that some companies are eager to copy Mr. Welch, long viewed as one of the most successful managers in America.

In the current market, hedges (longer term contracting and financial) are being done primarily by the producers and marketers, which results in a thin and probably off-kilter market (the LDCs buying for the customers are not participating). I know we have to square this with the EES positions, but I am not up to speed on what is going on in CA on this issue. Phillip also made that point that while the LDCs are focusing on their core load, no one is doing system planning on the macro basis, taking into account the ability of the physical systems to meet the needs of all customers, core and non-core and making sure the system will be adequate. Finally, he is very interested in seeing the CA LDC rates unbundled.

{"subject": "Chase/JP Morgan Meeting on Financing Methanol Project", "body": "Mike and Jeff, This note is to update you on information we have related to the GTL Methanol project in Darwin, Australia. Larry, John and I met with Chase/JP Morgan, specifically, the banker who led the financing of the Titan Methanol Plant in Trinidad. We wanted to get an independent opinion on the financeability of the current GTL structure and insights into the current market for project bank debt for commodity deals. The key opinion of Steve Nordaker, the Chase banker on the Titan deal, was that project banks do not take commodity price risk unless they have a very clear, supportable view of the long-term market price for that commodity. As for methanol, with the high level of uncertainty about the demand and price for methanol as tied to the future of MTBE, Steve said that Chase would need a profit margin contractually guaranteed by the project documents before lending to a project. Steve further suggested that if the gas supply contract had a floating price tied to methanol prices with a floor price, that floor should be around $0.50/ mmbtu to give the lenders comfort that the plant would remain competitive over the years required to repay the debt. GTL has agreed to a fixed price of $1.02/mmbtu with Phillips. Chase would not lend to the Darwin Methanol project as structured with a fixed price for the gas input and an index price for the methanol off take. Nordaker thought that it would be very hard to find even one bank to take the unhedged risk on the methanol margin. In fact, GTL will need at least ten banks to raise the full $250 million of senior project debt. Another key risk that Chase would not take is the strength of the Sponsor, in this case GTL. GTL has a total market cap of approx. $30 million. It will have to issue new shares equal in value to more than its current market cap to fund its portion of the project equity. If the project experiences cost overruns, the Lenders will expect someone with a high credit rating or demonstrable financial strength to invest whatever amount is needed to finish construction. I think that GTL is taking a big risk of wasting several months before finding out that its project is not financeable. In addition to the waste of time, GTL will have signed a gas supply agreement that will have to be renegotiated, and other key documents may need to be amended. EGM will not get the methanol it wants on time and may be faced with the choice of 1) taking on extra methanol price risk (by agreeing to buy more of the plant's output at a fixed price or by providing sponsor support) or 2) dropping out of the deal. If we have hedged some risk in anticipation of the project succeeding, then we will face pressure to take on more risk to cover the hedges. I think that GTL's deal is fixable, and John wants the methanol. I, therefore, recommend that we push GTL on several key structural elements so that GTL achieves a feasible project and so that EGM receives its methanol on time. Because EGM is only willing to buy 1/3 of the plant's production of methanol at a fixed price, the most important point is to get Phillips to agree to a floating gas price. Kevin Alexander of GTL says that they have tried, but that Phillips would not accept it. If necessary, we should offer to intervene with Phillips. We will, also, try to keep GTL realistic on the time it takes to negotiate project documents (six to nine months) and to issue public equity (no limit if the markets turn bad). John, Larry and I are developing a plan to move GTL to a realistic structure. We may need your help with Phillips. We will keep you apprised.

{"subject": "anniversary", "body": "Hi, sistas- Here's the scoop on the Josephine House: We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required. Parties under 20: $200 room fee. $50 valet parking fee. I confirmed \"17\" with mom. Heidi sent some sample menus. A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree, dessert) is $45. A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52. Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course. The food sounds really good. So, here's a guess at cost: 17 people at $45 = $765 Beverages = $200 Gratuity = $193 Valet = $ 50 Room rental = $200 TOTAL $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into thirds What do you guys think? Should we explore other options - or just go with this? I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but probably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.

These products were designed to replicate the most actively traded over-the-counter energy instruments, introducing the added benefits of clearing services; a neutral, centralized marketplace; and a highly sophisticated technological platform. While there may be additional products developed for introduction at launch, including more internationally based contracts, and there will certainly be more shortly thereafter, these contracts were selected as natural adjuncts to our established markets because of their close relationships to these liquid benchmarks. The contracts include: A West Texas Intermediate crude oil calendar swap contract A Henry Hub natural gas swap contract based on the final settlement price for the Exchange's futures contract Spread calendar swap contracts based on the differential between Platts (a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies) quoted prices for Gulf Coast unleaded 87 gasoline and the Exchange light, sweet crude oil and New York Harbor unleaded gasoline futures contracts Spread calendar swap contracts based on the differentials between the Platts quoted price for Gulf Coast Pipeline No. 2 heating oil and the Exchange light sweet crude oil and New York Harbor heating oil futures Basis swap contracts based on the differential between the final settlement price for the Henry Hub natural gas futures contract and Inside FERC's Gas Market Report quoted indexes for Henry Hub; El Paso San Juan Basin; Houston Ship Channel; and Transco Zone 6 Basis swap contracts based on the differential between the Exchange Henry Hub natural gas futures contract and the Canadian Gas Price Reporter Alberta spot month price (based on AECO C/NIT) Basis swap contracts based on the differential between the Exchange Henry Hub natural gas futures price and the Natural Gas Intelligence quoted index prices for Chicago City Gate and the southern California border Louisiana Light Sweet and West Texas Sour crude oil contracts A Dubai crude oil calendar swap Terms and conditions include a unit size of 1,000 barrels for each of the crude oil and petroleum product/crude oil spread contract; 42,000 gallons for each heating oil and gasoline contract; and 5,000 million British thermal units (mmBtus) for each natural gas contract.

Sitting at my desk trying to get used to being here in the office and having people shout hey Mrs. Ruppert is kind of freaky too. I'm ready for my afternoon siesta which I've become accustomed to in the last couple weeks. Well I must say the honeymoon was amazing! Everything I could have wanted and just what we needed. We truly had a wonderful time. The trip there was quite exhausting especially after the wedding and all. we got settled into Athens around 4 p.m. Monday. Our hotel had a balcony which had a wonderful view of the Acropolis. Athens is pretty dirty and the Greeks there are kind of assholes, but I really didn't think it was as bad as people kept telling me, I mean its a big city. We did our own walking tour of all the ruins (I try to avoid large groups of formal tours). We took a ferry to Santorini and stayed there for 3 days. Loved it! We ate some faboulous restaurants on cliffs overlooking the water. Lots of shrimp, squid, lamb, vegetables, bread and of course my favorite THE WINE! We rented a car one day and drove all over the entire island stopping periodically at various beaches to absorb the rays. Unfortunately we hadn't anticipated laying out so we didn't bring swimsuits. As being the sport I am I wanted to be apart of the culture so I took the rays in in just my briefs. Ryan surprisingly left his shorts on this time??? Loved the black beaches! We tried to find a more private beach to partake in some skinny dipping, but were busted at our attempt. We went to an area called Oia on Santorini, which was amazing. We drove down the mountain and at the bottom there was this bay area enclosed in rock with a few tavernas. so we had dinner there and watched the sunset. The most amazing seafood! They took us in their kitchen to show us what they had caught that day. We also took a boat out to the volcano at Ryan's request being a geologist and all. We hiked 2 1/2 miles all uphill and then of course back down. We went to the hot springs which Ryan said wasn't so hot, I did not venture in the water. After the ride we had to get all the way back to the top so we took donkeys of course. Quite an adventure as we were weaving around these narrow paths on the edge of the cliff! Luckily mine was tame, Ryan's however was a jackass(mmm, appropriate I thought). We also took a ferry to Ios, which unfortunately it rained the whole day so we stayed inside, slept and later went to some bars and met some great people which we later went out with that night. You all should have seen Ryan at the discos! Our final destination was Naxos about a 2 1/2 ferry ride from Santorini. Ate, shopped, toured the island, slept on the beach, drank, ate again and slept. Loved this island a lot. Not as touristy and the greeks were very pleasant and charming. Would have loved to stay there longer. All in all the wedding was fabulous. I was very happy with the wedding festivities too. And of course as everyone had said it went by sooo fast. The next morning Ryan and I were so confused about what had taken place the night before. I cannot believe I am a married woman, its all so surreal! The few days prior to the wedding I was so nervous and emotional about everything! Its just so overwhelming. One of the best parts was sitting on the alter in the cathedral and looking out upon our friends and family and people's faces lighting up. Knowing that all those people were there to share in our special moment was just so wonderful. Of course I wish I could have spent more time chatting with each and everyone one of you. We were so honored you all traveled so far for us! I am definitely on cloud 9 now and would have to say I feel the happiest I've ever been! Thanks again for joining us it truly meant a lot.

The group has begun the lengthy process of applying for regulatory approval, which could take up to 4 years. Led by Imperial Oil, the group consists of Conoco, Shell Canada, Exxon Mobil and now includes a company controlled by Northwest Territoriesnative people. The partners, known as the Mackenzie Valley Producers Group, could spend up to C$250 million before they decide whether to proceed with the project. The natural gas reserves would be produced from Imperial's 3 Tcf Taglu field, the 1.8 TcfParsonsLakefield, owned by Conoco and Exxon Mobil, and Shell's 1 Tcf Niglintgak field. The project would include a pipeline to carry up to 1 Bcf per day of natural gas to Albertaalong the Mackenzie Rivervalley at a estimated cost of C$3 billion. The natural gas would then be transported to Canadaand the US. Last year, the group signed an agreement with Northwest Territoriesnative leaders that would give the region's people a 33% share in the pipeline and provide other economic benefits. Even if the Mackenzie Delta project did not start pumping for 5 or 6 years, it likely will still be ahead of the Alaskan project, where BP, Exxon Mobil and Phillips are planning development of their reserves.

Also, there is a provision with the confirm (drafted by Chase) where Enron may request a change to any alternate \"Price Source for any Floating Price for all or a portion of any Notional Quantity...\" We have made two such requests, on April 22, 1999 and again on May 27, 1999. We were notified this month of a third request for change, and although our paperwork here is unfortunately not perfect, I followed the format for what we sent out twice previously.

I have the original confirmation down here - and if you need to see that too, I'll run it up to you. Thanks.", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them. It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion. It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system.

Last week a couple of heavy hitters left money on the table. Mark McGwire, the home-run-hitting baseball player for St. Louis, retired. And he let it be known that he never signed a two-year, $30 million contract his agent negotiated last spring. Why? Because he wanted to find out if his injured right knee would allow him to play as well as he had before. It didn't, and he decided he wasn't worth that kind of money. Then Ken Lay, chairman of Enron Corp., said he won't take the $60.6 million he had coming to him in a severance agreement that comes into play when Enron is sold to Dynegy Corp. Of course, neither McGwire nor Lay will ever have to consider my fallback retirement plan - sacking groceries at the supermarket, carrying them to the car and hoping for a big tip. Still, it was a class act on both their parts. McGwire only hit .187 last season, well below his lifetime average. And Lay? Well, let's say that rarely in the history of American capitalism has a company sunk as fast as Enron. Remember that earlier this year its stock hit a top of $82 a share. Now it's hovering in the single-digit level, and Enron is being forced to sell itself to a smaller rival. The stock price incentive How did Enron get into this position?

Apologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really aren't relevant. Most of the money top executives receive doesn't come from base pay or bonuses but from stock options. Such options usually work this way. Executives are given hundreds or thousands of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future date. The sales price can be anything from 10 cents to the price of the stock on the date the options were granted.

Carol Gary Taylor 06/28/2000 11:16 AM To: Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Bombardier memo Carol, I left you a message last week regarding the enclosed letter. You asked to see a copy... Background: Enron and Bombardier developed a promotional campaign to help sell snowmobiles. Retail customers who purchased snowmobiles from various retail vendors by October 1 were eligible for a $1,000 rebate from Bombardier if the subsequent November-March snowfall was less than 1/2 the average of the previous 3 years. In October, Bombardier reported to us the number of snowmobile sales in each city covered under our program and paid us a predetermined premium for each unit sold. In return, Enron was liable for potential payouts in each of the cities covered under the program (different payouts in each city depending on the number of Bombardier units that were sold in each city). The settlement date for the program was June 14 - allowing for true-ups by the various weather services. As of this date, we were responsible for payouts in 6 cities. We sent prompt payment to Bombardier. Current Issue: Bombardier has requested that we send a letter to to them, on our letterhead, specifying the actual Nov-Mar snowfall amount in each city covered under our contract with them. They plan to forward this letter to the stores that sold Bombardier snowmobiles under this program. The impetus for this letter is that some customers in cities where snowfall exceeded the strike (no rebate payments due to customers) thought/think that they may be entitled to a rebate. Here is the letter: Of course, I am waiting for your response before I send this letter out.

Baxter is a key member of the team that built Enron's successful wholesale energy business, said Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay. The promotion will help enhance that business.

Oct. 18, 2000, 11:25PM Houston Chronicle Businesses feel strains of political 'shakedown' By KAREN MASTERSON Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau WASHINGTON -- Business executives are being tapped for record amounts of money to support political campaigns and are tired of what one calls the \"shakedown\" by candidates and their parties, according to two studies released Wednesday. Nearly $256 million has been raised in so-called soft money -- unlimited contributions from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals to political action committees. That figure is five times the amount of soft money raised in the presidential election year of 1992, according to the Federal Election Commission. A poll of businesses released Wednesday shows that the pressure put on corporate executives to make large contributions is creating a backlash that could lead to reform next year in Congress. The study reveals that 75 percent of corporate heads feel pressure to give; half said they fear repercussions if they turn down requests for money; and, consequently, 60 percent support a ban on soft money. Overall contributions -- for spending on both campaigns and issue ads -- have surpassed those made during the 1996 campaigns for president, the House and the Senate by $430 million. This election cycle's total, now at $1.6 billion, reflects contributions made in the 18 months leading up to June 30. Those against the influence of money on politics worry most that much more is to come. Their estimates put total campaign contributions up to $3 billion -- more than the total budget of many small countries -- once the remaining months of this year are accounted for. \"Even before this election season began, we knew that the 2000 election was going to be one for the record books,\" said Larry Makinson, executive director of Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that watches campaign contributions and their influence on policy. A lot is at stake this year, including the White House and control of the House, where Republicans hold a narrow majority. Democrats also hope to recover at least a few seats in the Senate. The center's analysis of FEC records shows that the computer industry leaped from a rank of 55 in campaign giving in 1990 to eighth place this year, providing $25 million in nearly equal amounts to Democrats and Republicans. \"By splitting their money, the industry has gotten just about everything it's asked for from Congress,\" Makinson said. Among those requests are a moratorium on an Internet sales tax and an increase in immigration visas for high-tech job applicants. Efforts to ban soft money have been made on Capitol Hill, but have gone nowhere. And the two presidential candidates who made a soft-money ban central to their campaigns -- Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J. -- lost their primary election bids.

Both test came back abnormal and I am seeing a specialist this week to determine if I need to have a biopsy or not. Since God has given me the task of doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy. I trust and believe that God will heal.

Both test came back abnormal and I am seeing a specialist this week to determine if I need to have a biopsy or not. Since God has given me the task of doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy. I trust and believe that God will heal. God gave me a revelation several months ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our family, we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you at this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten mad. So he has decided to try and pull me down once again. I refuse to be brought down off this spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God. That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors I need you to be in prayer with me this week. I see the specialist on Thursday and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002. I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.

Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product. Main argument: Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows \"marketer firm\" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources. Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation \"owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,\" and 2) a Network Customer \"must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract\" in order to designate a Network Resource. Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource: - permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems - Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation - allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity - since retail providers are allowed to rely on \"over-the-counter\" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.

Also, if this info is not what you want can you be more specific as to exactly what you want reported on these two companies? let me know if this helps, thanks Monika Causholli\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

In-house counsel are frequently asked to provide their companies legal advice in a vast array of legal areas. With corporate downsizing, understaffed legal departments are usually not equipped to deal with the many complex and varied legal issues that are presented on a daily basis. Time is precious, as well, and in-house attorneys consistently find themselves hard pressed to attack these difficult legal problems with the degree of care required for thorough research and analysis. Traditionally, corporate counsel respond by utilizing outside law firms for many research and writing projects that could have been done internally if only they possessed the knowledge, resources, and time. Too often, these practices involve an inordinate amount of \"reinventing the wheel\", leading to inefficiency and burdensome expense. Outside counsel bill at exorbitant hourly rates while utilizing inexperienced, junior associates. The subsequent learning curve only adds to the enormous costs for corporate counsel. Because associates lack knowledge in the fields that they research, the total number of hours that they spend tend to be excessive. With soaring associate rates, the ultimate price for corporate counsel often reaches the upper stratosphere.

Meagan is on the drill team and must be at all games. Last year, we played right up to Thanksgiving in the playoffs. So, we have decided to pick a weekend in the spring after drill team contest season is over to make that trip with Meagan. We are interested in caps, shirts, etc. for UT, OU and Texas Tech.

Since such transaction would need to be priced based upon the credit rating of the entity or the sponsors (depending upon the structure) the expected returns will not justify the balance sheet impact on Northern Border Partners if this entity were to function as lessor. Furthermore, I have assumed that this conclusion also holds true from Enron's perspective given their strategy of reserving balance sheet capacity for higher return projects. Since the bid parameters do not specify a lease requirement, Trailblazer may already have funding in place. If not, EAMR could insert language in the bid that they or their designee would arrange lease financing for the project upon selection of EAMR as the winning bidder. At that point, we would work with commercial banks or major leasing companies to develop a cost-effective financing transaction. I hope this addresses your questions regarding the feasibility of such a transaction, but please call me at x7843 in Omaha if you wish to discuss further.

The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around people availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set. The schedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate two hours for the Friday meeting. If you had set aside two hours, that had not been communicated to us. There were only two one-hour meeting slots on that schedule. One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4. I have a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting that Ken Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs through the evening hours.. Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a religious holiday, I decided to \"skip out\" from this meeting to be here on Friday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets together. In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orchestrated the time swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW meeting at 3:00. I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the commitment for Ken Lay. Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution that works for both of us. I would appreciate your help on that, Louise. Scheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES budget that ENW has prepared. Our approach so far has been to determine the appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business. We have done this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA. That is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provided and our best estimate at costs. We are prepared, however, with a suggested split on the costs for discussion purposes. I have assumed that the decision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of the chair for EES and ENW. If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets together, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer block of time (maybe 3 hours?). I will bring my schedule to our meeting at 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule that works for both of us. We will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the components of costs and the detail of capital projects. Our review of costs and projects in effect will serve as our \"scope of engagement\" discussion. A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had been reached on the scope of the engagement.

Clearly, I would like you to set up the meeting with the RiskCalc gurus to dig deeper into their methodology (as much as they'll tell) and the impact of missing variables and any other idiosyncracies the model may have.

I know from a previous conversation with Lea Carty and reading about the model that it was calibrated off North American names but they suspect it might extend to other countries. Conversely, I know they are working efforts within Moody's Risk Management Services to develop private (and probably public) firm models specific to regions. One they mentioned was Australia and also within Western Europe. Data, as always, was the issue. See if the quants have any perspective on their success/plan in that area. Lastly, we truly appreciate the aggressive efforts you both have made toward pushing off this private model initiative and I'm very confident we'll be able to nail a firm plan down upon receipt of either D&B and/or Experian data.

I have attached the request form for each of these changes at the bottom of this memo. Please ensure that everyone in your group obtains a copy. The procedure to set up a new curve is as follows: Trader starts trading at a new location or a new commodity and needs a new curve set up Trader communicates this to risk management Risk management constructs new curve in ERMS (with the help of the IT department) Risk management completes a curve set up request form to set up curve in RisktRAC Curve form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up curve in RisktRAC A system generated message is sent to people on the \"curve list\" indicating a change in the RisktRAC curves has been made If the curve is not set up in RisktRAC the positions are not captured in the VAR or engine, thereby making VAR inaccurate. As a side note, Risk Analysis and Reporting has implemented a new process in which on a weekly basis new curves set up in ERMS are reviewed to ensure that these have been set up in RisktRAC. We did this for the first time today and noted numerous curves in ERMS that are not in RisktRAC - which we are working with you to resolve. The procedure to set up a new book in RisktRAC is as follows: Trader/risk management determines new book is needed New book request form (for RisktRAC) is completed by risk management New book request form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up book in RisktRAC Risk Analysis and Reporting forwards request to ERMS administrator and globa", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

In addition, ComEd has included a cover letter which indicates a significant level of uncertainty regarding a '01 interconnect at Plano. Under the guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission Tarriff, we are required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of receipt (7/7/00) in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the ComEd queue. If we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the ComEd queue becomes the date of execution of the LOI. Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron with an Interconnection Study (IS) and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days (ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed). The IS and PD will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect. The IS and PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the next 2-3 weeks). ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain current. ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line prior to the project with the superior queue position. I will request that this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect). I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon. I believe that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the interconnect design. It also addresses the ordering and payment responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed interconnection. Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this week, we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior to having a clear value proposition in our sights. I will have recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday. I am simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so. From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI. I believe that we executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines Green Land Development, L.L.C.

In addition, ComEd has included a cover letter which indicates a significant level of uncertainty regarding a '01 interconnect at Plano. Under the guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission Tarriff, we are required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of receipt (7/7/00) in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the ComEd queue. If we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the ComEd queue becomes the date of execution of the LOI. Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron with an Interconnection Study (IS) and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days (ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed). The IS and PD will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect. The IS and PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the next 2-3 weeks). ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain current. ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line prior to the project with the superior queue position. I will request that this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect). I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon. I believe that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the interconnect design. It also addresses the ordering and payment responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed interconnection. Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this week, we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior to having a clear value proposition in our sights. I will have recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday. I am simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so. From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI. I believe that we executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines Green Land Development, L.L.C.

The study is the first head-to-head comparison of Zyprexa and valproate since the FDA's approval of the use of Zyprexa for bipolar mania in March. Key Findings Dosing was based on both drugs' package inserts (see Study Design for more information). The study's primary efficacy measure was the Young-Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS), an 11-item scale used to assess the severity of a patient's mania. Key study endpoint findings included: ? The Zyprexa group experienced a significantly greater improvement on the Y-MRS total score than did patients treated with valproate (49% vs. 38%). ? A greater proportion of Zyprexa patients achieved remission from manic symptoms (defined as Y-MRS Total Score < 12) compared with valproate patients (47% vs. 34%). ? 54% of patients on Zyprexa experienced a 50% or more improvement in Y?MRS scores compared with 42% of the valproate patients. ? Zyprexa patients demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in certain Y-MRS Individual Item Scores compared with valproate patients: activity/energy (53% vs. 41%), sleep (69% vs. 45%) and language-thought disorder (49% vs. 35%). Changes in other core symptoms of mania as defined by the Y-MRS Individual Item Scores were similar for the two treatment groups. Study Design The three-week, randomized, parallel, double-blind, acute-phase study examined 251 hospitalized patients at 44 sites who met the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and were experiencing acute manic or mixed episodes. Subjects received olanzapine in a flexible dose range of 5 to 20 mg/day (once daily) or valproate in a flexible does range of 500 to 2,500 mg/day (multiple doses per day). The mean ending dose for Zyprexa was 17 mg/day and the mean ending dose for valproate was 1500 mg/day. In addition, plasma levels were monitored to ensure valproate trough levels were maintained within the targeted therapeutic range of 50-125 ?g/mL; the mean value of all levels obtained was 79.4 ?g/mL. Clinicians determined dosing based on each patient's clinical response as well as the blood levels in patients taking valproate. Lorazepam use was restricted to a maximum dose of 2 mg/day, and administration was prohibited within eight hours of a psychiatric exam. Additional Study Results Neither Zyprexa nor valproate induced depressive symptoms in bipolar manic or mixed patients. In fact, both Zyprexa and valproate patients showed an improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21). However, Zyprexa patients showed greater improvement at the study endpoint in HAMD-21 scores (35% vs. 24%). The effects of Zyprexa have not yet been studied in bipolar depression. Zyprexa was generally well tolerated. The most common and significantly different adverse events for Zyprexa were somnolence (39.2% vs. 20.6% for valproate), dry mouth (33.6% vs. 6.3%), and increased appetite (12.0% vs. 2.4%). The most common adverse event for valproate was nausea (28.6% vs. 10.4% for Zyprexa). Additional safety information for Zyprexa and valproate can be obtained from their package inserts. \"These data support the value of Zyprexa as a much needed treatment option,\" said Mauricio Tohen, M.D., Dr. P.H., medical adviser, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, and lead investigator for the study. \"The findings provide further evidence that Zyprexa effectively stabilizes mood in patients with bipolar disorder.\" Manic symptoms occur duri", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

{"subject": "LADWP Gas Contract", "body": "Dear Potential Gas Supplier As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement will come to an end on December 31, 2001. While we will honor current commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to use the spot agreement to buy any more gas. The reason that this is happening is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now. We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of agreement most gas suppliers are familiar. We have the ordinance approved by the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep us operating. I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are doing. The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM. We will take the executed contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and, if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new year begins. This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem. I can't make any changes to this contract.

On the monies they owed us under the gas lift contract, we gave them until May 10th to respond or we would institute litigation.

Summary of our offer: Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01. Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%. In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC. In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework. Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end. However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal: Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates. Some agreement on DWR stranded costs. John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals. Some agreement on forebearance. I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table. We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning. The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals. Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions. While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week. In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value. Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated. Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

{"subject": "Revised Gas Accord II Mtg Schedule", "body": "CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT DOCUMENT PER CPUC RULE 51 ALL PARTIES: Based on feedback from a number of parties, we have decided to postpone next week's Gas Accord II Workshop. The Workshops previously scheduled for January 10-11, 2001, and January 24-25, 2001, will not be held. We tentatively plan on holding the next Workshops on February 7-8, and February 21-22, 2001. We request that you pencil in these dates on your calendars. We will confirm these dates later, hopefully by next week, once we learn the procedural schedule for the ongoing Rate Stabilization hearings before the CPUC. The Gas Accord II Workshop on February 7-8 (tentative dates) will be informational in nature, and will focus on reviewing and explaining PG&E's comprehensive Gas Accord II Settlement Proposal, which was distributed by e-mail on December 21, 2000. We then propose to use the following Workshop, scheduled for February 21-22 (tentative dates), to receive specific feedback from parties, and engage in detailed, substantive discussions. Attached below is a revised schedule for suggested workshop dates and timing, beginning with the tentative February 7-8 Informational Workshop. We continue to believe that PG&E must be in a position file an application with the Commission - either a settlement or PG&E's litigation case - no later than the middle of this calendar year. The mid-year filing date is necessary in order to allow sufficient time for the Commission to consider the issues and render a decision, and for PG&E to implement the decision by December 31, 2002, which is the date the current Gas Accord, OFO and Gas OII settlements effectively end. Between now and the upcoming February Workshops, we encourage Parties to continue to review the December 21 Settlement Proposal, and to contact us with any questions and concerns. PG&E representatives also will be available to meet with Parties individually, or in small groups, to go over the Settlement Proposal in detail, prior to the February Workshops. The purpose of such smaller sessions will not be to negotiate any details, but only to explain the PG&E Settlement Proposal, and respond to questions. Please feel free to contact either of us, and we can make the necessary arrangements for such a meeting. We appreciate all the input various parties have provided regarding the scheduling issues, and we hope this revised schedule is responsive to your concerns.

Attached below is a revised schedule for suggested workshop dates and timing, beginning with the tentative February 7-8 Informational Workshop. We continue to believe that PG&E must be in a position file an application with the Commission - either a settlement or PG&E's litigation case - no later than the middle of this calendar year. The mid-year filing date is necessary in order to allow sufficient time for the Commission to consider the issues and render a decision, and for PG&E to implement the decision by December 31, 2002, which is the date the current Gas Accord, OFO and Gas OII settlements effectively end. Between now and the upcoming February Workshops, we encourage Parties to continue to review the December 21 Settlement Proposal, and to contact us with any questions and concerns. PG&E representatives also will be available to meet with Parties individually, or in small groups, to go over the Settlement Proposal in detail, prior to the February Workshops. The purpose of such smaller sessions will not be to negotiate any details, but only to explain the PG&E Settlement Proposal, and respond to questions. Please feel free to contact either of us, and we can make the necessary arrangements for such a meeting. We appreciate all the input various parties have provided regarding the scheduling issues, and we hope this revised schedule is responsive to your concerns.

The following are EIA's changes to the original Alternate Policy proposal circulated by EPSA on August 2. The following items would be held confidential: EIA - 423: cost of fuels (not previously collected by EIA) Purchase price would also still be held confidential, as noted on the original Alternate Policy. EIA-423 basically duplicates FERC Form 423. EIA-906: fuel stocks (currently held confidential) Stocks was originally \"crossed out\" on the Alternate Policy, but it is now back on the list of data items to be held confidential. EIA-826: energy service provider data on sales, revenues and number of customers Under the original Alternate Policy, regulated utilities and wires companies would have also been able to keep this same information confidential. Now it will only be data submitted by ESPs that will be held confidential. However, please note that EIA-861 collects this same data from ESPs and that data will be released on an annual basis. EIA-767: Under the revised Alternate Policy, no data submitted on the 767 will be held confidential This is a change from the original Alternate Policy. The original Alternate Policy includes estimated useful thermal output, plant financial information, cooling system costs, etc. as data to be held confidential. The data will now be released 12 months after year-end. EIA-860: Maximum tested heat rate (currently confidential) No change from original Alternate Policy. EIA-861: No data submitted on the 861 will be held confidential No change from original Alternate Policy. EIA-411: No data submitted on the 411 will be held confidential. No change from original Alternate Policy. EIA-412: Generator plant costs and expense data only for unregulated plants (not previously collected by EIA) No change from original Alternate Policy. I've attached a copy of the original Alternate Policy in case you need it. Please forward any comments on these changes to me no later than noon Eastern Time on Friday, August 31. EIA anticipates a Federal Register Notice on or around September 7. There will then be a 30-day comment period on the proposal submitted by EIA to OMB. We will notify you when the Federal Register Notice is issued.

Officials deny price gouging. By DOUG SMITH, RICH CONNELL and ROBERT J. LOPEZ Times Staff Writers September 10 2001 During the peak of California's power crisis, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power earned far greater profits selling electricity to the rest of the state than agency officials have previously acknowledged, according to a newly completed independent audit. The document, obtained by The Times under the California Public Records Act, seems sure to reinforce charges by some consumer advocates that the public power company effectively helped its customers at the expense of those suffering blackouts and rate hikes. The audit also undercuts efforts by Gov. Gray Davis and others to pin the blame for rising energy costs mainly on private, out-of-state generating companies. For months, DWP officials have deflected questions about their prices by insisting that the agency sold power for just 15% above its costs. As recently as July, former DWP chief S. David Freeman, who now heads Davis' new statewide power authority, repeated that assurance in a letter to U.S. senators probing the energy meltdown. But the audit findings show that DWP's profits from electricity sales to power-starved areas of the state averaged 56% last year under Freeman's stewardship. Overall, during the worst 13 months of the crisis ending in May, records show that the DWP profited $200 million on sales of $680 million. It says it is still owed $180 million. Beyond those higher profits, the DWP included expenses in its cost component that have little to do with generating electricity. They include a $34-million cut for the city's general fund--essentially a bonus for the utility's owner--and an additional $42 million in overhead for such things as debt payment and return on the agency's capital investments. These overhead charges are three times higher than the amount considered reasonable by federal regulators. In effect, unsuspecting ratepayers across the state, whose utilities have been battered by debt, are helping to pick up the tab for services that DWP consumers and city taxpayers would otherwise have to pay. In an interview late last week, Freeman defended those costs and DWP's profits, saying the agency went out of its way to help the state avert blackouts by cranking up its output from costly plants. He insisted that he had issued \"standing orders\" to sell power at a profit of no more than 15%. \"We made a fair amount of money. It was not price gouging,\" said Freeman, who contends that he led efforts to cap spiraling wholesale prices last year. Freeman said he has not seen the audit but if profits were higher than 15%, then \"I'm not embarrassed about it. It says nothing more than there's enterprise at [the] DWP.\" The DWP's new general manager, David Wiggs, said that his staff had found no documentation as of Friday to confirm the existence of a strict pricing policy within the agency during Freeman's tenure. \"Maybe in hindsight,\" Wiggs said, \"it would have been better not to be so specific, but to say, 'Look we're gonna limit our recovery to a reasonable return for our customers.' \" Still, Wiggs said, even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated, it was not excessive. \"We charge", "label": "phishing", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

{"subject": "Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast", "body": "Dear Eric, Let the Enron hearings begin - both the Senate and House begin hearings on the fallen energy giant Thursday. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearing will focus on whether federal agencies should have foreseen the company's demise. A second Enron hearing on Thursday in the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations subcommittee will look into the destruction of Enron-related documents by Andersen. The Washington bureau will have live reports and highlights from the hearings on Capitol Hill throughout the day. Also from Washington on Thursday, another Senate subcommittee will look at whether it's time to raise the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards. Senate Democrats are expected to add CAFE increases in their comprehensive energy bill and this hearing is the next step in the process. Vinson & Elkins attorney Bill Weiland talks with the Houston bureau about bringing oil and gas from Russia to the United States through the Caspian region. Weiland says there are rules over which countries' ships are allowed into ports in the Caspian Sea. On Thursday, Weiland will talk about the complications and added expenses these rules place on U.S. imports from the Caspian region. Also from Houston, we'll have a report on a class-action lawsuit filed against Andersen. The plaintiffs are accusing the auditing firm of racketeering. This is the first lawsuit against Andersen charging the firm with violations under the RICO act. From the West Coast on Thursday, Portland General Electric Spokesperson Scott Simms joins us to discuss electricity restructuring in Oregon. ENL's Kym McNicholas will speak with Simms about some new options for electricity customers starting March 1, 2002. Simms joins us during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast. We'll have earnings updates from New York on Thursday - Merrill Lynch Analyst Daniel Rolling will join us during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast to discuss Arch Coal and Consol Energy earnings. We'll also be joined by UBS Warburg's Matthew Warburton Thursday. He's going to bring us Conoco earnings and fourth-quarter expectations for the oil sector. Don't miss Warburton during the noon ET newscast. Closing Prices for Wednesday, Jan. 23, 2002 Crude: $19.50/bbl +$0.52 Unleaded: $0.5635/gallon +$0.156 Heating Oil: $0.5253/gallon +$0.112 Gas: $2.076/mmBtu -$0.030 Fwd uE(Feb.): $3.43/mmBtu -$0.16 Video Library: ENL's interview with Secretary of Interior Gale Norton is now logged in the Video Library.

However, as natural gas prices scale to new heights and with the electric transmission system contributing to power outages in San Francisco, it has become clear that the problem is more complex, and that plant developments alone won't resolve the power crisis in the west. While it is clear that something must be done, and done quickly, it is not nearly as clear what the right combination of \"fixes\" is. What is the most cost-effective solution to the energy shortfall? This conference, Energy Infrastructure Crisis in the West, will offer a comprehensive view of the shortcomings of the current energy infrastructure--generation, natural gas pipelines and storage, electric transmission-and how these shortcomings might be addressed through development. You will hear from legislators, regulators, and state officials how they are encouraging the development of new energy infrastructure, and from developers and utilities what it will really take to quickly respond to infrastructure needs. Specific issues that will be addressed include: Legislative, utility and consumer views on how to solve the energy crisis Developing new generation--what should be done to expedite the process? Electric transmission bottlenecks--can a solution be quickly found? Beefing up the region's natural gas infrastructure--comparing pipeline and storage expansion proposals If you are considering the development of energy assets in western power markets, attending this conference is your best opportunity to learn about the prospects for success.

This may or may not appear in some edited form as an op-ed piece in the WSJ. Although this statement is in my own words, I believe it is consistent with the Manifesto. I would appreciate feedback from my fellow economists if I have made statements that contradict the Manifesto, or most critically have made arguments that they feel are not sound economics. I will try to incorporate suggestions in the next draft. Thanks for your reaction. I am also sending copies of this draft to a couple of people in the media other than the WSJ, and they are welcome to use the content but not the text if they want a summary of my take on the crisis.

Unfortunately, many of you are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your staff's salary is. I have the average salary for each of the different staffing levels. I have asked the HR department to also give me the low and the high. Let's face it - your staff today and their salary most likely are not what they are going to be next year! To much movement of people. So using estimates and averages will probably be as accurate as using current salary levels. Here's what you can do: 1) Make a list of your staff just their positions. 2) Then put down if you think I should budget high, mid, average, low, low to average, etc. You can guess at this based on their experience, length of time in that position, etc. 3) Then I will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget. 4) Here is the average: Sr. $4,961 Spec $3,964 Staff $3,026 Sr. Clrk $2,548 Clerk $2,264 Asst $3,162 Your list would look something like this: Assistant Average Clerk Very High Sr. Clerk Low Specialist Low to Average Specialist Average Sr. Specialist Average to High Analyst (They are all allocated at the same amount) You can , however, use the exact amounts if you have them. It's up to you. Next Item - TRAINING!!! Here's what you can do: 1) List your staff and the type of class they need 2) If you don't know the exact class you want to send them to, then list what type of class - for example personal enrichment (i.e. Time Management) or Technical (Derivatives or Applied Finance or Wellhead to Burnertip) 3) The personal enrichment classes cost aroung $500-$700 4) The technical classes cost aroung $800 - $1000. 5) Just list the type of class, and I'll do the rest. Next Item - Headhunters! Try 20% of the new hires salary for their fees. Other Stuff - I have made a list of all of the unusual items we do during the year that people forget about at budget time (i.e. flowers for secretaries day, birthday ice cream, offsite meeting costs, customer gifts). If you forget these items, I will make sure it is added to your budget. Once I put all of your budget information into the spreadsheets, we will review them so that they can be adjusted as necessary and you can approve them.Hopefully this helps you some.

Other Stuff - I have made a list of all of the unusual items we do during the year that people forget about at budget time (i.e. flowers for secretaries day, birthday ice cream, offsite meeting costs, customer gifts). If you forget these items, I will make sure it is added to your budget. Once I put all of your budget information into the spreadsheets, we will review them so that they can be adjusted as necessary and you can approve them.Hopefully this helps you some.

Unfortunately, many of you are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your staff's salary is. I have the average salary for each of the different staffing levels. I have asked the HR department to also give me the low and the high. Let's face it - your staff today and their salary most likely are not what they are going to be next year! To much movement of people. So using estimates and averages will probably be as accurate as using current salary levels. Here's what you can do: 1) Make a list of your staff just their positions. 2) Then put down if you think I should budget high, mid, average, low, low to average, etc. You can guess at this based on their experience, length of time in that position, etc. 3) Then I will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget. 4) Here is the average: Sr. $4,961 Spec $3,964 Staff $3,026 Sr. Clrk $2,548 Clerk $2,264 Asst $3,162 Your list would look something like this: Assistant Average Clerk Very High Sr. Clerk Low Specialist Low to Average Specialist Average Sr. Specialist Average to High Analyst (They are all allocated at the same amount) You can , however, use the exact amounts if you have them. It's up to you. Next Item - TRAINING!!! Here's what you can do: 1) List your staff and the type of class they need 2) If you don't know the exact class you want to send them to, then list what type of class - for example personal enrichment (i.e. Time Management) or Technical (Derivatives or Applied Finance or Wellhead to Burnertip) 3) The personal enrichment classes cost aroung $500-$700 4) The technical classes cost aroung $800 - $1000. 5) Just list the type of class, and I'll do the rest.

I would like to also share with you that a friend of mine had to have one of her breast removed on last week and I know it was a test of her faith. She does nothing but minister to everyone through prayer, words of encouragement; and now this has happened to her to trust and be challenged in her faith. I do believe I will be okay and I also believe you heard my cry for a reason. I do need your prayers and everyone else's. I do need your prayers so that I can be at peace. Thank you so much for caring. I will definitely keep you posted between now and next Thursday December 21st when I go in for my Ultra Sound. Your friend in Christ, Davette Dana Davis@ECT 12/11/2000 02:30 PM To: Davette Warren/HOU/EES@EES cc: Subject: prayer Davette, Greeting to you in the name of my Lord and Savior Jesus! This is the letter that I spoke of that was sent to me this morning from one of the ladies at my church. She also forwarded this message to several other women outside of our church. I want you to read it because I believe that it will encourage you to trust God if you are not and hold tight if you are because the effectual fervent prayers of the righteous do avail much. Like I breifly stated earlier, I will have my prayer ministry group pray for you tonight and we will keep on praying for you until I hear you tell me ALL is well. We try to meet every Monday night to pray over special prayer request that we have received along with praying for the needs our families, friends, church, government and even our enemies. Our meeting start at 7pm but we really don't get started praying until 8pm so if you want to touch and agree with us around that time that would be great. We're all in this together if you hurt we hurt. : ) I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me this week. For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a lump I found under my arm. As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an ultrasound of my breast. Both test came back abnormal and I am seeing a specialist this week to determine if I need to have a biopsy or not. Since God has given me the task of doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy. I trust and believe that God will heal. God gave me a revelation several months ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our family, we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you at this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten mad. So he has decided to try and pull me down once again. I refuse to be brought down off this spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God. That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors I need you to be in prayer with me this week. I see the specialist on Thursday and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires in Chinese November 27, 2000 Reforms in India Are Tantalizing, But Debates Cool Investor Ardor By DANNY PEARL Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL NEW DELHI, India -- The tumblers of economic reform have slowly but surely been turning in India over the past decade, each click resonating through this nation of a billion people. Lately the prospect of unlocking its markets has seemed a bit brighter -- but not bright enough to impress foreign investors. Every day, India's financial pages are filled with news of a new opening: a plan to sell the government's stake in a big car company, the lifting of controls on the textile industry. But the fine print tells another story: stubborn hurdles to foreign investment, insistence on public control and open battles among ministers that could force Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to protect his diverse coalition government rather than take fresh economic gambles. \"The debate over reforms will be endless unless there is a crisis, and there is no crisis around the corner,\" says Mahesh Vyas, executive director of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy, a private organization. India is still coasting along with economic growth above 6% a year. Still, there are some worrisome signs. Last month, Standard & Poor's lowered its outlook on the Indian rupee because of the darker prospects for economic reform. Foreign investment, already a pittance compared with the rest of Asia, has slackened recently, and a few big companies, including Enron Corp. of Houston and British Telecommunications PLC, are freezing some India investments as their focus shifts to more-developed markets. Just 14% of the multinational-company executives recently surveyed by AT Kearney said they were more likely to invest in India than in China; 56% said the reverse. Even critics think Mr. Vajpayee's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which one year ago won a mandate to lead its second coalition government, is sincere about pushing for further opening of India's statist economy. But what government officials call the second generation of reforms -- India's Congress Party launched the first in the early 1990s to allow more private enterprise -- is meeting stiff domestic resistance. Workers and traditional Indian businesses are as scared of competition as ever, and the Congress Party, now in the opposition, is playing on those fears. So the government is moving in small, often contradictory steps. \"Their hearts are in the right place,\" says John Band, executive director of ASK Raymond James, an affiliate of the American investment bank. Here is how the reforms are shaping up in five critical areas. Privatization India's program of selling off government companies is still mostly talk, but much of it could come to fruition in the next few months. While the government probably won't meet its target of raising 100 billion rupees ($2.14 billion) this fiscal year, it is likely India will shed some perennial money losers.

I am confident that this process will yield a method that accurately reflects the cost of EnronOnline and allows each of you to make sound financial decisions about your plans to use EnronOnline in 2002. Please don't hesitate to call me before Friday with questions, and I look forward to meeting with you.

Here's my numbers (I got them from etrade!!!!!): 0 - 5000 transactions per day $ 8:00/normal transaction (including internals) > 5,000 transactions $ 10:00/normal transaction Options $ 10:00/ per option (using option grid) Take or Pay Minumum Number of transactions per annum = 1,000,000 Service Interruption (outage) Reduction in our bill of $100,000 (less than 30 minutes) Reduction in our bill of $500,000 (greater then 30 minutes) Per product type set up 0 (its in your interest as the number of transactions is high in ENA. It think this issue is for other groups.) On development 0 (its in your interest - I think this again an issue for other groups.) Now we all have the same incentive - grow the number of trades. I think this is pretty close for us. Only paying once for a sleeve trade. Let the games begin!

The projection is based upon EIA's monthly analysis of delivered gas prices for residential, commercial and industrial customers for selected states (Connecticut, Virginia, Illinois and Texas) for the 1999-2000 winter heating season (Nov-Mar). Assuming pipeline and LDC mark-ups remain constant, the delivered prices were adjusted for the NYMEX Henry Hub projection of wellhead prices for the 2000-2001 winter period. A national projection is also included. Because the commodity portion of the gas bill for residential customers is a smaller percent of the total bill compared to commercial and industrial customers, the increase for residential customers will be less pronounced than for commercial or industrial customers. In addition, LDC purchased gas cost mechanisms will moderate the effect of the price increase to some extent because monthly price increases are averaged out over an extended period (12 months in some cases). Furthermore, some state public utility commissions (e.g. Connecticut) are conducting meetings with LDCs to discuss looking for ways to lessen the impact of the projected increases. That being said, Nipsco recently announced residential prices are expected to increase 50-60% this winter over last winter (in line with the projection for Illinois).

Facts: NTEC has an all requirements G & T contract with Rusk. NTEC has contracted to provide firm power to RUSk for Enron's contract, barring force majeure. NTEC has block bid this power on the open market. Bids are due 6/27/01. REGULATORY OPTIONS 1. Alternative Counterparty (a)SWEPCO: It appears that the franchise for the service territory relevant to this deal is dually certified to both RUSK and SWEPCO (I am working to verify this). If the service territory is singly certified to RUSK, then no alternative counter party is eligible to supply power to the Enron contract. However, if the territory is dually certified to SWEPCO, then SWEPCO could be an alternative counter party for the Enron contract instead of RUSK. That should if applicable, resolve the creditworthiness issue and the ability to have recourse against a substantial counterparty in the event of default. (b). NTEC: Enron can enter into some 3rd party contractual arrangement with NTEC and a wholesaler, whereby there is direct pay between Enron and wholesaler, though title technically passes through NTEC. For instance, after the bids come in, Enron can enter into a 3 party arrangement with NTEC and the winning bidder. NTEC is a more substantial counterparty than RUSK and Enron can have recourse against NTEC in case of default. 2. Reliability/Replacement Power: (a). Enron can establish onsite DG as back up. (b) If the DG is offsite, Enron can, depending on the location of the power, self wheel over NTEC or SWEPCO's transmission lines to contract site. However, this may be inefficient due to increased line losses to back the power onto the grid. (c) Enron can Enter into a backup power arrangement with a wholesale power provider to supply the power required under the Enron contract. Once again, this arrangement must be originated through NTEC, because of its all requirements contract with RUSK. However, if Enron substitutes power at market price for the NTEC power, Enron will bear the cost of the higher priced power. NTEC has a long term partial requirements contract with SWEPCO, thus their power is much cheaper than market priced power. 3. Deregulation Options (a) RUSK opts out of Deregulation: Senate Bill 7, Sec. 41.052, states that an Electric Coop that chooses not to opt in to retail choice \"retains the right to offer and provide a full range of customer services and pricing programs to the customers within its certificated retail service area and to purchase and sell electric energy at wholesale without geographic restriction.\" Depending on the value of this deal and the outstanding term of Rusk's contract with NTEC, Enron can persuade Rusk to renegotiate that contract or buy NTEC out. Enron can then step in as the wholesale supplier of power to RUSK. (b) RUSK opts in to deregulation: Enron can persuade RUSK to opt in to retail competition under an arrangement whereby Enron guarantees to RUSK that their current rates will remain at a predetermined stable position. The downside is that there may be minimal stranded cost issues, and the upside will be that RUSk can market to customers outside its sevice territory yielding potentially higher revenues. Questions: 1. What are the terms and conditions of the contract between RUSK and NTEC, what are RUSK's termination or renegotiation righ", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

NTEC is a more substantial counterparty than RUSK and Enron can have recourse against NTEC in case of default. 2. Reliability/Replacement Power: (a). Enron can establish onsite DG as back up. (b) If the DG is offsite, Enron can, depending on the location of the power, self wheel over NTEC or SWEPCO's transmission lines to contract site. However, this may be inefficient due to increased line losses to back the power onto the grid. (c) Enron can Enter into a backup power arrangement with a wholesale power provider to supply the power required under the Enron contract. Once again, this arrangement must be originated through NTEC, because of its all requirements contract with RUSK. However, if Enron substitutes power at market price for the NTEC power, Enron will bear the cost of the higher priced power. NTEC has a long term partial requirements contract with SWEPCO, thus their power is much cheaper than market priced power. 3. Deregulation Options (a) RUSK opts out of Deregulation: Senate Bill 7, Sec. 41.052, states that an Electric Coop that chooses not to opt in to retail choice \"retains the right to offer and provide a full range of customer services and pricing programs to the customers within its certificated retail service area and to purchase and sell electric energy at wholesale without geographic restriction.\" Depending on the value of this deal and the outstanding term of Rusk's contract with NTEC, Enron can persuade Rusk to renegotiate that contract or buy NTEC out. Enron can then step in as the wholesale supplier of power to RUSK. (b) RUSK opts in to deregulation: Enron can persuade RUSK to opt in to retail competition under an arrangement whereby Enron guarantees to RUSK that their current rates will remain at a predetermined stable position. The downside is that there may be minimal stranded cost issues, and the upside will be that RUSk can market to customers outside its sevice territory yielding potentially higher revenues.

Thank you -----Original Message----- From: Ogenyi, Gloria Sent: Wednesday, June 27, 2001 12:08 PM To: Nemec, Gerald; Murphy, Harlan; Kiani-Aslani, John; Knippa, Mark; Bennett, Peter Cc: Scott, Susan M.; Kingerski, Harry; Steffes, James; Nicolay, Christi Subject: ENRON COMPRESSION SERVICES DEAL ISSUES: Counter party creditworthiness, reliability of power delivery, ability to procure replacement power. Facts: NTEC has an all requirements G & T contract with Rusk. NTEC has contracted to provide firm power to RUSk for Enron's contract, barring force majeure. NTEC has block bid this power on the open market. Bids are due 6/27/01. REGULATORY OPTIONS 1. Alternative Counterparty (a)SWEPCO: It appears that the franchise for the service territory relevant to this deal is dually certified to both RUSK and SWEPCO (I am working to verify this). If the service territory is singly certified to RUSK, then no alternative counter party is eligible to supply power to the Enron contract. However, if the territory is dually certified to SWEPCO, then SWEPCO could be an alternative counter party for the Enron contract instead of RUSK. That should if applicable, resolve the creditworthiness issue and the ability to have recourse against a substantial counterparty in the event of default. (b). NTEC: Enron can enter into some 3rd party contractual arrangement with NTEC and a wholesaler, whereby there is direct pay between Enron and wholesaler, though title technically passes through NTEC. For instance, after the bids come in, Enron can enter into a 3 party arrangement with NTEC and the winning bidder. NTEC is a more substantial counterparty than RUSK and Enron can have recourse against NTEC in case of default. 2. Reliability/Replacement Power: (a). Enron can establish onsite DG as back up.

Also, we need to meet on Entex this week as you suggest. In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex can account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these nominations are not related to intra-month price volatility. We discussed having an initial meeting next week. Then, if it makes sense, I think we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to be a key factor in Entex changing their nominations. These meetings would be to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve communication and establish more definitive criteria for changing nominations. The end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a solution to past sins and a way forward. Brian Enron North America Corp.

Also, we need to meet on Entex this week as you suggest. In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex can account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these nominations are not related to intra-month price volatility. We discussed having an initial meeting next week. Then, if it makes sense, I think we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to be a key factor in Entex changing their nominations. These meetings would be to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve communication and establish more definitive criteria for changing nominations. The end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a solution to past sins and a way forward. Brian Enron North America Corp.

I would like to know if there is anything you want me to do about this matter or if I should pass your advice on to Dan Hyvl. I haven't been involved in any Entex or regulatory advisory matters with Brian to this point, I simply received an e:mail from Dan asking for a second opinion. Please let me know. Steve Barbara N Gray 09/27/2000 05:57 PM To: Steve Van Hooser/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: Coogler's Response I don't think Brian, the President of HPL should be having any meetings with Entex................if someone is to meet with Entex, it needs to be an ENA person; similarly, we should not be asking for a meeting with Entex. If ENTEX wants to schedule a joint meeting,it might be okay to attend............depending on the subject matter...........ANYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH PRICING SHOULD NOT BE DISCUSSED...........i BELIEVE MORE FACTS NEED TO BE MARSHALLED. Steve Van Hooser 09/27/2000 05:06 PM To: Barbara Gray cc: Subject: Re: Coogler's Response Barbara, I had a chance to look at this again and I have left a note for Dan (he wasn't in his office) indicating that if by \"I think we should involve MidCon in the discussions\" Brian intends a joint meeting among ENA, MidCon and Entex to discuss the correction fo nomination irregularities, I think that's an acceptable proposal. If, however, Brian intends a private meeting between MidCon and ENA to discuss our respective contractual obligations to Entex, then I think Dan needs fo advise Brian of the risks attendant to such a meeting. Do you agree?
