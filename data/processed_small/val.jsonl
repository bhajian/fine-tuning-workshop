Please read this. She would like to meet with you. -----Original Message----- From: Storey, Geoff [mailto:Geoff.Storey@ENRON.com] Sent: Thursday, January 10, 2002 3:33 PM To: Connie L. Babbitt Subject: Disclaiming Insurance Connie, I think we finally decided how much money we want to disclaim for purposes of funding the trust. We will not be diclaiming the house but will try to disclaim two life insurance checks, an ADD through Jimmy's employer, Marsh & McLennan, and held with CNA and the credit card Travel Accidental Death Insurace held through American Express. I will be talking to the Larry Harman about the process of doing this. It will add about 450k to the estate and take the probate assets up to about 1.4M or 700k for the trust. [Connie L. Babbitt] That sounds good. There are always complications when a personal residence is put in a disclaimer trust, so I believe you are making the correct decision there. Is there any deadline or timelines on when the trust must be setup? [Connie L. Babbitt] No, but the disclaimer must be filed with the probate court by June 11, 2002. Is there a form to send to the IRS to request a tax ID for the trust? [Connie L. Babbitt] Yes, an SS-4 Form. We can prepare one for your mother's signature. My mom wants to know if we need to meet with you or when? [Connie L. Babbitt] I would like to meet with her. I think she will be more comfortable if she's had a chance to meet me personally, although it's certainly not required. I visit many of my clients at their home, so I could meet at her house if that would be more convenient for her. She may prefer a meeting fairly soon to answer any general questions she may have about the estate, trust funding, and distributions of assets. If our firm will be preparing the 2001 income tax return, I would also need to meet with her to obtain all the 1099s, W-2s, etc for the 2001 return. A meeting around the end of January, beginning of February would probably be good timing for that. When will we find out what those new regulations will really mean for our estate income taxes? [Connie L. Babbitt] Once I see the 2001 1099s, W-2s, etc and get a better grip on all the income sources, we ought to be able to zero in better on the issues. At first blush, I would anticipate very little tax liability for 2001. I'm hoping the IRS will be issuing further guidance to address more details, e.g. spousal income, etc, over the next few weeks. I'm sorry I can't give you a more definitive answer on this one.

We're also looking to increase your exposure with employees. We have a new idea, which Sherri discussed briefly with you a couple of weeks ago. It's called \"Jeff's Corner\" and it will be a regular video message that will be posted on the intranet -- which can be accessed by 99.9% of our employees. This is how it will work. We will tape a 2-3 minute video of you talking about what's top of mind at that moment. The tone and style will be like your floor meetings (one of your best employee venues), casual and conversational. We suggest the first topic be \"The State of Enron.\" There is a lot of talk among employees about the cheap shots we've taken as a company and by you and Ken, about the decline in our stock price and about the widespread re-deployment efforts. These recent events are beginning to affect morale. Employees are concerned and want to be assured that we're on the right side, that they will have jobs, that Enron will be here next year. You've helped reassure them about these things at recent floor meetings; however, that is only a small part of our global work force. Having your own corner on the intranet will have a farther reach, and we have the capability to do this in-house at very low cost. We recommend making this a regular communication feature at least monthly, although since this would only involve a few minutes of your time, you could even tape a message to employees weekly. The nice thing about this medium is we have the ability to respond immediately to current events, and having you speak to employees gives the message credibility. Future topics could address new cost saving procedures, update on Dabhol, the PRC, reasons behind an organizational announcement, The Pulse survey, etc. We'd like this to be a forum where you can talk about topics you'd like to discuss. I've checked with the technical team, and we have the capability do this now. I will check your calendar with Sherri. Let me know if you have any questions.

These recent events are beginning to affect morale. Employees are concerned and want to be assured that we're on the right side, that they will have jobs, that Enron will be here next year. You've helped reassure them about these things at recent floor meetings; however, that is only a small part of our global work force. Having your own corner on the intranet will have a farther reach, and we have the capability to do this in-house at very low cost. We recommend making this a regular communication feature at least monthly, although since this would only involve a few minutes of your time, you could even tape a message to employees weekly. The nice thing about this medium is we have the ability to respond immediately to current events, and having you speak to employees gives the message credibility. Future topics could address new cost saving procedures, update on Dabhol, the PRC, reasons behind an organizational announcement, The Pulse survey, etc. We'd like this to be a forum where you can talk about topics you'd like to discuss. I've checked with the technical team, and we have the capability do this now. I will check your calendar with Sherri. Let me know if you have any questions.

We're also looking to increase your exposure with employees. We have a new idea, which Sherri discussed briefly with you a couple of weeks ago. It's called \"Jeff's Corner\" and it will be a regular video message that will be posted on the intranet -- which can be accessed by 99.9% of our employees. This is how it will work.

{"subject": "FW: PIPELINE NOTES, NO. 46", "body": "-----Original Message----- From: Ben Cooper [mailto:bcfarm@starpower.net] Sent: Sunday, November 25, 2001 2:48 PM To: Ben Cooper Subject: PIPELINE NOTES, NO. 46 PIPELINE NOTES FROM WASHINGTON Vol. 4, No. 46 November 23, 2001 Association of Oil Pipe Lines (202) 408-7970 (202) 408-7983 (fax) bcooper@aopl.org The opinions if any expressed in these notes are the author's only and do not represent the views of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines (but they should). 1. Pipelines Announce Joint Push for Legislation Five pipeline associations, representing the vast majority of the domestic pipeline deliveries of oil and natural gas, wrote to Department of Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta this week pledging to cooperate in a proactive approach to pipeline safety reauthorization legislation. A number of pipeline CEOs and trade association heads signed the letter, which included a one-page position summary of the longer joint position paper we reported on earlier (NOTES, No. 40, October 12, 2001). This public communication sends the important message that the pipeline industry is united in its view of the need for reauthorization legislation and has agreed on a core set of principles and provisions upon which this legislation can be based. We will have this correspondence up on our website soon, but if you need a copy sooner, let us know and we'll send it to you. 2. Commission Denies Rehearing of Olympic Suspension The Commission this week denied Tesoro's request to suspend Olympic's proposed rates for the full seven months permitted under the Interstate Commerce Act. The Commission found the order \"in the public interest as it allows the increased rates to be collected, and during the period the proposed rate increases are examined to determine whether they are just and reasonable, they remain subject to refund.\" If Tesoro proves its case, it will get refunds with interest. If Olympic is prevented from collecting the rates, that revenue is lost forever. The Commission favored giving Olympic the option of getting that revenue. The order can be found at http://cips.ferc.gov/Q\\CIPS\\OIL\\IS\\IS01-441.00E.TXT. 3. OPS on Right-To Know Post Sept. 11 http://www.gopbi.com/partners/pbpost/epaper/editions/today/news_b3ff4359b34c 525c1000.html -- Sept. 11 has pipeline regulators rethinking public access to records. 4. FERC Releases New Search Engine The FERC has been upgrading and improving its website, www.ferc.gov. Today it announced the testing of a new search engine to help users find documents more easily across FERC libraries and files. For more on the new search engine, see http://cips.ferc.gov/Q\\CIPS\\MISC\\NR\\NR01-59.000.TXT. 5. EPA Seeks Comments on Diesel Emissions Standards EPA is seeking review and comment on a Staff Technical Paper regarding non-road diesel emission standards.

Pipelines Announce Joint Push for Legislation Five pipeline associations, representing the vast majority of the domestic pipeline deliveries of oil and natural gas, wrote to Department of Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta this week pledging to cooperate in a proactive approach to pipeline safety reauthorization legislation. A number of pipeline CEOs and trade association heads signed the letter, which included a one-page position summary of the longer joint position paper we reported on earlier (NOTES, No. 40, October 12, 2001). This public communication sends the important message that the pipeline industry is united in its view of the need for reauthorization legislation and has agreed on a core set of principles and provisions upon which this legislation can be based. We will have this correspondence up on our website soon, but if you need a copy sooner, let us know and we'll send it to you. 2. Commission Denies Rehearing of Olympic Suspension The Commission this week denied Tesoro's request to suspend Olympic's proposed rates for the full seven months permitted under the Interstate Commerce Act. The Commission found the order \"in the public interest as it allows the increased rates to be collected, and during the period the proposed rate increases are examined to determine whether they are just and reasonable, they remain subject to refund.\" If Tesoro proves its case, it will get refunds with interest. If Olympic is prevented from collecting the rates, that revenue is lost forever. The Commission favored giving Olympic the option of getting that revenue. The order can be found at http://cips.ferc.gov/Q\\CIPS\\OIL\\IS\\IS01-441.00E.TXT. 3.

Nathalie Bomar ----- Original Message ----- From: Amy & Alistair <mailto:barnesfamilyus@prodigy.net> To: emca@yahoogroups.com <mailto:emca@yahoogroups.com> Sent: Wednesday, October 24, 2001 8:30 PM Subject: *EMCA* Mosquitoes I hate to do this, and do not want to put anyone out, but I need some help. The mosquitoes are terrible. It is hurting me to look at Kendall (my son) any more, as the number of bites on him have gone into the double digits. I cannot imagine that we are the only ones suffering from these nasty little pests, and I want to do something about it. If any of you have time tomorrow, can you do me this - can you call Harris County Mosquito Control and help me complain? I figure that if a whole load of us start calling, they won't be able to ignore us. Their number is 713-440-4800. I get a recording when I call, but their hours are 8 - 5, so maybe we can talk to a live person tomorrow. Thank you for helping me, and ultimately helping everyone.

Also, I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles? Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

{"subject": "First EPSA FERC Lunch", "body": "A couple of months ago, we formed a new group within EPSA called the Regulatory Affairs, Washington Staff, group (the name needs some help). We discussed many things the group can do to increase our EPSA presence at FERC, including establishing monthly lunches featuring a different FERC guest/speaker per lunch. Yesterday, Donna and I attended the first lunch of the group, sponsored by Mirant (Enron will be sponsoring the July lunch). The FERC guest speaker was Don Gelinas. (We believe Don had a big part in the Entergy Source & Sink order, so he is an important person to know.) There were about 12 people at the lunch, which was a good number because it gave us all a chance to speak with Don and get to know him a little better. The group was relaxed and festive, and I think this put Don at ease as well. Don made a few remarks at the end of the lunch. He said the Commission's main focus (other than California) was on the RTOs and getting them up and running by the end of the year. He said FERC's main concerns are on: 1)independence, 2) appropriate incentives, and 3) appropriate scope. Don acknowledged that having sufficient scope is a problem with a voluntary program, but he believes the Commission, under Hebert's leadership, will be able to gradually expand the scope of the RTOs so that ultimately there are only a handful of RTOs in the country. Furthermore, Don said there are certain issues he believes must be included in RTO filings, including putting native load under the RTO tariff. However, he says that phase-in may be necessary, and the trick will be in finding a reasonable phase-in period. Other issues that Don said may require actual FERC decisions (FERC calling balls and strikes) will be on issues such as ATC, CBM and curtailment. Don said ATC should be calculated the same way by all RTOs and that the question of retaining CBM must be decided by FERC. Based on these comments, these three areas may be places where we could get some FERC support for our views. We should keep this in mind as we comment on future RTO filings. Let us know if you have any questions or comments. Sarah and Donna", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

Per Jim's request for the database. (I don't know if you want to put the values that Kevin is giving into the database). (1) Completed the negotiations and FERC filing of the Next Hour Market scheduling proposal. When implemented, scheduled for June 2000, this will provide one stop shopping for next hour business. Ties OASIS and TAGGING together into one request. Also if a tranmission provider cuts the transmission the PSE only pays for his actual use versus what he originally scheduled. This will speed up the ability to schedule the next hour non-firm. This order is an important recognition by FERC that its OATT did not cover hourly, which we complained about alot at FERC's hotline last summer. 2) Successful in obtaining the release of all ISN (system information) to marketers in the WSCC region. This was an individual effort by Dick that has been benificial for our traders in the WEST. Successfully prevented the WSCC Operating Committee from taking action that would have reversed this effort. 3) Assisted in getting the initial control areas in SERC approved last year and preventing ATC changes this year and OC changes that would have negated the Control Area effort. 4) Dick served as Co CHAIR of the ISO committee that put the SPP contract in place that eliminated MW mile pricing in SPP and will serve as the basis for SPP's RTO. 5) Dick was appointed to the NERC Control Area Task Force which was formed as a result of our the success of the Enron Control Areas in TVA and have so far been successful in keeping this effort so that it is non punitive. This has turned into a very positive process that may result in a new configuration of the NERC relibiability effort. (6) Dick's made comments to ENTERGY that helped push Entergy into filing their new scheduling procedure (ultimate source and sink) with FERC. This was initially going to be implemented unilaterally March 1 without a FERC filing and Enron would have been forced into an after the fact complaint situation at FERC where we are not allowed to get damages that we would have incurred in the meantime (See Comm. Massey's concurrence in Aquila v. Entergy about the lack of incentive to file complaints). Kevin Presto said that winning the protest at FERC (due 4/12) would be worth $100 MM. (7) On 2/2, TECO revised its proposed generator imbalance charge from minute by minute to hourly accountability (notably, TECO revised its proposal before FERC issued an order based on the EPSA protest herein.) We worked with EPSA to file an EPSA protest to TECO\u0001,s proposal. We didn\u0001,t like TECO's proposal but had commercial concerns about filing a protest in our own name (since Enron is working with TECO on a project). We were able to get EPSA to protest this issue in TECO's initial filing. Enron is planning to site generation in Florida, but we don't have the value on this win yet. (8) FERC issued a NOPR on January 28 proposing to revise the way it assesses annual charges to public utilities. Enron, along with several other participants (Dynegy, Koch, APX, Citizens, NP Energy, Sonat and Williams), filed a petition for rulemaking with FERC in August, 1998, requesting FERC to revise its methodology for assessing annual charges, arguing that FERC's current system of assessing annual charges on sales for resale of power discourages trading, impedes reliance on competitive markets for power, and could create competitive advantages for utilities over new power marketers entering the market.

However, I wanted to offer the following ideas for discussion with you and the others listed above as to potential inclusion in the Wildhorse letter: A. Should we request written notification from Wildhorse related to the shut-in status of Entrada production? Should we request written notification related to the recent curtailment of Dakota production? [As we've discussed, Enogex never requested anything in writing from Wildhorse, so we do not have any historic documentation of Wildhorse's claims]. B. Should we identify (potential) contractual issues due to the curtailment of Dakota production; e.g. Sec. 6 detailing the (wellhead) delivery pressure requirements under this contract, et al? [As we've discussed, the system pressures have increased due to (initially) gas being re-routed by Wildhorse over the past two years which has loaded the San Arroyo system, and now the NWPL quality issues and subsequent Wildhorse curtailments has increased pressures system-wide. If Wildhorse based their ability to allow these problems to persist by referring to Sec. 7 \"Gas Quality\" of the agreement, what remedies can we request....partial release of Dakota gas?]. Here's the frustration, based on conversations with producers in the area and the documents we've received from Enogex, Wildhorse has continued to attach non-pipeline quality spec gas to their system over the past couple years to increase gathering revenues, yet has not invested any $$$ for processing of this gas to meet or exceed the specs of downstream pipelines. Then, they use the downstream pipes as the reason for shutting in all their captive producers, and have thus far offered no solutions to the system pressure and quality issues discussed above. Therefore, its critical that this letter gets to the \"right\" people within Wildhorse and, if possible, make reference to some element of timing (e.g., reasonable dispatch, commercially reasonable manner, etc.).

{"subject": "Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast", "body": "Dear brad, The Department of Energy is hosting a conference on Clean Coal Technology on Monday in Washington. The conference will take a look at where coal-fired generation could be headed in the future. U.S. Energy Association Chairman John Derrick, the Chairman and CEO of Pepco, is among those scheduled to speak. Look for energy legislation to move to the forefront when lawmakers return from Thanksgiving break. Republicans in the Senate say they want to take action on energy legislation in December, while Democrats aren't as sure of the time frame. Next week, the Washington bureau will bring us an update on where legislation stands and what the chances are that we'll see a comprehensive energy bill before the end of the year. The North American Electric Reliability Council will release its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment on Tuesday; our Washington bureau will bring us coverage. If MTBE is banned, the gasoline industry will have to drastically increase production of ethanol. On Monday, the Houston bureau's Gale Smith will have a report on some companies looking at alternative ways of making ethanol. We'll find out which products have a chance at becoming a substitute for MTBE. A recent poll taken by Deloitte & Touche says power deregulation in Texas won't mean an immediate rate reduction for consumers. The Houston bureau will have more from Deloitte & Touche's Branko Terzic on Monday. ENL's Kym McNicholas reports the California Power Authority is meeting over the weekend to discuss the scope and direction of its Energy Resource Investment Plan. The plan is due to the legislature and to the governor by February 15, 2002. Kym will bring us the latest on Monday from the weekend meeting. Also on Monday, the California Energy Commission will hear a petition for reconsideration of its decision on Calpine's proposed Metcalf Energy Center. After the meeting we'll have comments from the counsel to the petitioners Stephan Volker. Jolen Operating Company President David Fleischaker will speak with us from Oklahoma City on Monday. He'll give us a status check of energy legislation and discuss what he feels is the real problem behind Enron. We'll hear from Fleischaker during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast. From Dallas on Monday, RBC Capital Markets Director Mark Easterbrook is joining us. Easterbrook will talk about the performance and outlook for Master Limited Partnerships in the energy industry and which investors are suited to buy MLPs. Catch him during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast. Broadcasting Note: I just want to give you a heads up on the schedule for next week. ENL will be dark on Thursday and Friday for the Thanksgiving market holiday. Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. Have a wonderful and relaxing weekend!

The conference will take a look at where coal-fired generation could be headed in the future. U.S. Energy Association Chairman John Derrick, the Chairman and CEO of Pepco, is among those scheduled to speak. Look for energy legislation to move to the forefront when lawmakers return from Thanksgiving break. Republicans in the Senate say they want to take action on energy legislation in December, while Democrats aren't as sure of the time frame. Next week, the Washington bureau will bring us an update on where legislation stands and what the chances are that we'll see a comprehensive energy bill before the end of the year. The North American Electric Reliability Council will release its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment on Tuesday; our Washington bureau will bring us coverage. If MTBE is banned, the gasoline industry will have to drastically increase production of ethanol. On Monday, the Houston bureau's Gale Smith will have a report on some companies looking at alternative ways of making ethanol. We'll find out which products have a chance at becoming a substitute for MTBE. A recent poll taken by Deloitte & Touche says power deregulation in Texas won't mean an immediate rate reduction for consumers. The Houston bureau will have more from Deloitte & Touche's Branko Terzic on Monday. ENL's Kym McNicholas reports the California Power Authority is meeting over the weekend to discuss the scope and direction of its Energy Resource Investment Plan. The plan is due to the legislature and to the governor by February 15, 2002. Kym will bring us the latest on Monday from the weekend meeting. Also on Monday, the California Energy Commission will hear a petition for reconsideration of its decision on Calpine's proposed Metcalf Energy Center. After the meeting we'll have comments from the counsel to the petitioners Stephan Volker. Jolen Operating Company President David Fleischaker will speak with us from Oklahoma City on Monday. He'll give us a status check of energy legislation and discuss what he feels is the real problem behind Enron. We'll hear from Fleischaker during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast. From Dallas on Monday, RBC Capital Markets Director Mark Easterbrook is joining us. Easterbrook will talk about the performance and outlook for Master Limited Partnerships in the energy industry and which investors are suited to buy MLPs. Catch him during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast. Broadcasting Note: I just want to give you a heads up on the schedule for next week. ENL will be dark on Thursday and Friday for the Thanksgiving market holiday. Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. Have a wonderful and relaxing weekend! Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

Let me know if you have any questions. ---------------------- Forwarded by Phil DeMoes/Corp/Enron on 11/20/2000 07:28 AM --------------------------- Les Webber @ ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 11/18/2000 03:47 PM To: Doug Arnell/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Nancy Corbet/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Daniel R Rogers/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, byamagata@akingump.com, masseye@arentfox.com cc: Shelley Corman@ENRON, Phil DeMoes/Corp/Enron@ENRON, David L Fairley@ECT Subject: SOUTHERN LNG re ELBA ISLAND LNG TERMINAL GREETINGS: On November 17, 2000 Southern LNG advised the FERC that it \"has determined to withdraw the Btu stabilization options from the instant certificate application\", such application being the one seeking to amend the certificate issued by the FERC in March, 2000 authorizing Southern LNG to reactivate the LNG terminal at Elba Island. With this withdrawal, the El Paso organization has drawn its line in the sand. We plan to vigorously protest this withdrawal at the FERC within the 15 day period allowed by FERC procedures. This gives us until December 2, 2000 to file which, presumably, would be extended until Monday, December 4, 2000. Our filing will be of an adversarial nature, so the Enron organization needs to be on board with our intended filing, which we will commence drafting on November 20, 2000. Drafts will be circulated to the appropriate personnel, so please advise us re any additions in that regard. At the same time, this decision by Southern LNG will focus our resolve to complete the commercial transaction with El Paso Merchant Energy. We have come to accept some of the less desirable features of the Letter Agreement/Term Sheet signed with El Paso Merchant Energy on October 13, 1999, inasmuch as the more important aspects are very much in our favor, including several that Southern LNG found rather unsettling. We will discuss the path forward with El Paso Merchant Energy on November 21-22, 2000. While we remain open to a solution to the quality issue that leaves our commercial flexibility and optionality intact, we must be positioned to move forward resolutely and in a timely manner with both El Paso Merchant Energy and Southern LNG. We cannot afford to stop these processes while we discuss alternative solutions. On Wednesday, November 15, 2000, we gave both Mike Varagona and David Jenkins of El Paso Merchant Energy a \"heads-up\" regarding our likely response to Southern LNG's proposed letter agreement dated November 1, 2000. We indicated we would be asking Southern LNG to bifurcate the FERC proceeding into the Vaporizer Project, that could proceed quickly and on an independent path to certification, and the Stabilization Project, that required considerably more technical analyses before it could proceed. When I contacted Mike Varagona on Friday, November 17, 2000, after we received a copy of Southern LNG's letter to the FERC, he stated that he had not been advised by Southern LNG regarding its decision, hence, had not been positioned to return the favor. Mr. Varagona will\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

I realize this is late notice; I did let Richter know awhile ago, but I probably should have spread the word a little further. I am truly sorry. At any rate (below the price cap of course), while I am gone I would be so appreciative if one of you could run the Dow Jones report in the morning and the EOL report in the evening. Dow Jones will only need to be taken care of from Wed. through Fri. of next week. I will call on those days, and I can easily explain the procedure over the phone to those of you who don't know it. If I call and you're ridiculously busy, just hang up on me. I'll call back later. The EOL report we have come to know and love is actually being fixed right now. I will talk with Nicolay Kraltchev, the Houston IT guy in charge of fixing it, on Friday, Dec. 22. It should be up and running again by Friday afternoon. Again, I'll call to check in and make sure this works, or explain how to use it. I'll be in the office on Monday, Dec. 25, just briefly to make sure it hasn't exploded in my absence, but then I'll be off to the land where tequila is better for you than water. Sounds terrible.

{"subject": "RE: Confirms in Word", "body": "You MUST carve this transaction out of the CSFBI master. The margin does NOT flow around the structure. If you read the confirms, you will see that Enron receives fixed 150MM from CSFBI day 1 and pays it back WTI basically at the end of the deal (that is where all the volumes are concentrated). Thus, this deal is out of the money to Enron 150MM and they can call us for that margin which we would have to post for the entire term of the deal. Our swap with MSCG has us paying fixed, but we do not pay it until the end of the deal (that is where all the volumes are concentrated). Thus, this swap could allow for either party to margin based on WTI price movement - but in essence, it is an at the money trade today. You will NOT be able to margin MSCG. Thus, the net effect is you have to post margin, but you do not receive any. If you do not carve this deal out of the margin arrangements, you wil defeat the purpose of executing a prepay - you will have to post the money they prepay you as collateral.

{"subject": "Re: examples of auction processes in Canada", "body": "Steve, Rob Hemstock will give you the details of the Alberta PPA auction. The only other auction type mechansims of which I am aware in Canada with respect to power supply are the following: a) Ontario electricity distributors have the choice of purchasing power for their default service customers ( called \"standard supply customers\" here) either directly from the IMO real-time market or from a third party supplier. If the distributor chooses to secure power from a third party supplier the distributor must employ a formal, transparent and auditible RFP process. Many Ontario distributors may opt for third party supply precisely because they want to avoid cash flow problems comparable to those facing the California IOUs - that is, if an Ontario distributor chooses to buy directly from the real time spot market, it must supply that power to default customers at a rate fixed by the provincial regulator - the Ontario Energy Board (\"OEB\") - and record the difference between the purchase cost and the rates charged in a deferral account. The amount in the deferral account will be debited or credited to customers periodically. However, the OEB has fixed the default service rate too low and, accordingly, distributors opting for supply directly from the IMO real time spot market may face very serious cash flow problems. The term of the third party supply that may be secured in this fashion is unclear, but as matters stand in Ontario there may be significant regulatory risk in securing supply more than 1 year out. (This was the first issue in respect of which Enron retained Seabron Adamson and Seab knows the issue well); b) An auction/RFP process is also included in the \"restructuring\" plan recently adopted by the Quebec National Assembly in respect of Hydro Quebec. The key features of that plan are the following: 1) a long term vesting contract between HQ Generation and HQ Distribution under which HQ Generation is obliged to supply HQ Distribution up to 165 twh annually; and 2) the requirement that HQ Generation secure any supply it needs over and above the vested amount through an RFP process to be approved by le Regie ( the provincial regulator).

In fact, his main concern about pipeline marketing affiliate practices relate to the fact that they differ from practices on the electric side. I am working with Jim Steffes and Christi Nicolay on a comparison of gas and electric practices in the following areas mentioned by Dan Larcamp. Here is a quick look at the areas that we are comparing: Contracting for transportation/transmission capacity. Pipelines currently have a form of service agreement in their tariffs, but they also enter into non-conforming agreements and discount agreements with shippers. In contrast, transmission customers enter a two-page standardized blanket transmission agreement. Then they reserve specific quantities and points on-line via OASIS. This is probably the area that we'll have the most difficult time arguing why we are different than the electric side. Negotiating discounts. Customers may call or fax pipeline staff to negotiate discounts, although sometimes a pipeline may post a generally available discount on the website. On the electric side, discounts are rarely granted, but if discounts are granted it is handled through OASIS. Functionality of OASIS vs. pipeline websites. Its true that the OASIS system facilitates the reservation of transmission space (i.e. contracting) and discounts, but it doesn't accommodate nominations, invoices, and index of customers or many of the other features available on pipeline web sites. Marketing affiliate rules. I plan to lay out a side by side comparison of Sec. 37 (electric rules) and 161 (gas marketing affiliate rules). One difference, the posting of organization charts, will be gone after September, as pipelines will add this information to the web site. Content of Form 1 vs. Form 2. Dan Larcamp mentioned that he feels like electric form 1s have more useful market data. I'm not sure we're comparing apples and apples, as the electrics are still integrated utilities and thus the form 1 includes sales data. But, we'll put together a comparison nonetheless. Hopefully, the detailed comparison can be completed in the next month. Also, FYI Enron Government Affairs is currently working on their comments to the latest OASIS rulemaking and plan to use the comparison work to suggest best pipeline website practices that could be a model for OASIS.

Highlights: ------------------------------------------------ - Shakespeare Debunked - Daily Dilbert by E-mail - Induhvidual Debating Techniques - True Tales of Induhviduals - Dogbert Answers My Mail ------------------------------------------------ DNRC Update ----------- The DNRC has a whopping 330,000 members, each one so shockingly attractive and intelligent that he or she can be used as a defibrillator. If you see someone whose heart has stopped, yell \"clear\" then press your hands on the person's chest (do not make the \"honk-honk\" sound if the victim is female) then start telling a witty joke. This method has never actually started anyone's heart, but sometimes the bystanders get a kick out of it. After Dogbert conquers the world you will have dominion over the so-called In-duh-viduals. A DNRC member suggests that Induhviduals above the age of 18 be called adolts. I like that. I propose that the ones under 18 be called juvenile duh-linquents. Dilbert by E-mail Program ------------------------- By popular demand, Dilbert strips can now be delivered to you by e-mail every day (Monday - Saturday).

If you forward this e-mail, the recipient will be able to change your Dilbert Newsletter subscription. Shakespeare Hoax ---------------- I have come to the unsettling realization that Shakespeare was an Induhvidual. In case you haven't read any Shakespeare since you were a gullible child, here's a little sampling of the Great Bard's work from Macbeth: -- start -- \"That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold; What hath quench'd them hath given me fire. Hark! Peace! It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman, Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it: The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd their possets, That death and nature do contend about them, Whether they live or die.\" -- end -- Now, maybe someone drugg'd my posset, but I'm fairly certain that none of that makes any sense. When I was a kid, if something made no sense to me, I assumed the problem was on my end. But now that I am an adult, and I know everything there is to know, I realize that the source of most confusion is Induhviduals - sometimes economists, occasionally poltergeists, but mostly Induhviduals. Maybe the word \"bard\" meant something different a few hundred years ago and that's what caused the confusion - as in, \"He was so full of bard you could grow squash in his earholes.\" Or maybe some Irish people attended Shakespeare's plays and said they were BORED, but it came out sounding like BARD to the English. That could've happened. There's really no excuse for Shakespeare's shoddy work. If you were Shakespeare, and you had nothing to do all day but sit around in huge pants and write plays, don't you think you could at least make them comprehensible? To me, that seems like the minimum requirement for a play: The audience should have a vague idea of what the actors are saying. I'm certain that the fans of Shakespeare will tell me I would enjoy his work if only I took the time to understand it. But that's like saying I would love polka music", "label": "phishing", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

{"subject": "Improved Process for Engaging Temporary Workers", "body": "As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy staffing requirements throughout the company. For the past several months, a project team, representing Enron\u0001,s temporary staffing users, have researched and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which source would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performance and cost containment objectives. The Business Unit Implementation Project Team members are: Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate George Weber, GSS In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA), Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the Selection Project Team. As a result of the team\u0001,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginning of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF\u0001,s Managed Services Group. This group will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best interests of the organization. We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001. This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced program. CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in service during this transition. We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha, Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001. The scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these two phases have been completed. Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we selected CORESTAFF\u0001,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to our staffing needs. The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective and simple means for obtaining temporary employees. In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF\u0001,s Managed Services Group will be communicating to Enron\u0001,s administrative/clerical temporary staffing vendors about the new process.

Both were granted on an interim basis. The court set a final hearing for May 9 at 9:30 am. PGE is to file its pleadings by April 20 and any opposition is due by May 4. The bondholder cash collateral motion was heard first. There was no opposition and the bond trustee (Bank of New York) consented to the relief. BONY and PGE are working on a final cash collateral stipulation. Next was the gas supplier motion. PGE mentioned in its presentation that the basis of the pre-petition agreement was the waiver of termination rights in the event of bankruptcy by the suppliers in return for a security interest in the receivables. Jim Lopes, PGE's lawyer, mentioned that he had learned a great deal about Bankruptcy Code section 556 in the last few months. Judge Montali nodded his head at that comment. Montali also asked whether PGE conceded that 556 applied. Lopes answered that he did not concede that it applied, but he was \"very concerned.\" I asked whether the post-petition security interest was available to suppliers that were not parties to the pre-petition agreements. The Court said that was up to PGE; Lopes said they were willing to talk about it, but they did not want to grant liens to all of their creditors and hoped creditors would rely on their administrative claims, which PGE believes will be paid in the ordinary course. Procedurally, the Court said it would not authorize any new security interests on the basis of the interim order resulting from today's hearing. Instead, that would have to be the subject of a separate motion with notice, and perhaps coujld be taken up at the final hearing. P GE also indicated that it is filing today a lawsuit against the CPUC seeking a TRO regarding a deadline of April 11 for the filing of certain advice letters. A hearing is tentatively scheduled on the TRO for 3 pm tomorrow, April 10.

I am doing this to ensure that we don't skip or miss anything that was being done on a day to day basis for the estate. I will take what info you give me and forward it on to Greg Couch so that he will be aware of all reports that needs to be ran daily.

The January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount the right to distribute natural gas within the city's incorporated limits as well as a specified area outside the incorporated limits. The contract goes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed into the city, \"the respective rights of the parties as to service in any such portion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutes of North Carolina. . .\" The contract further provides that absent an order of the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right to serve all end users within the \"aforementioned\" area--presumably referring to the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity. So, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount's right to serve arguably tracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be.

DJ CalPX Responds To FERC, Denies It Worsened Power Prices Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The chief executive officer of the California Power Exchange responded Tuesday to details in a federal energy regulatory report that suggests the two-year-old exchange's mandatory buy requirement was partly to blame for this past summer's soaring wholesale electricity prices. The details of the landmark probe prepared by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled to be released Wednesday morning, but some commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires the report will suggest that the state's mandatory buy rule should be abolished and utilities should be permitted to purchase their power through other power exchanges. \"We believe that the representation of the CalPX contributing to soaring wholesale prices is incorrect and misleading,\" said CalPX CEO George Sladoje. \"Over the summer months, certain wholesale market participants chose to not take full advantage of the price and cost mitigating products offered through the CalPX...if a participant chose to purchase all or most of their energy on the spot market, they often paid much more than other participants who chose to buy in the forwards market,\" Sladoje added. It is widely known in the wholesale electricity market that Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric Co. purchased most of their power in the spot market, which the utility passed on to its customers at a much higher price. SDG&E also complained to federal regulators that the CalPX hourly and day-ahead market clearing prices are too high. When California moved to electricity deregulation four years ago, a statewide power exchange was created requiring Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. to purchase all of their power through the exchange until 2002, the expected transition date to a completely deregulated market. But the FERC report proposes that utilities be permitted to purchase power from other exchanges in an effort to generate increased competition, commissioners said. The CalPX purchases power one day in advance for California's three investor-owned utilities. Suppliers bid in power indicating their price. For each hour of the next day, the price of the last megawatt taken to meet demand sets the market price. In various reports issued since 1996, FERC has commended the state's Power Exchange for running a successful market that helped mitigate concerns about market power abuses. If the FERC report suggests that California end the mandatory buy requirement, it will be up to state lawmakers to see to draft Legislation to change the market rules, according to the CalPX. -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 31-10-00", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

DJ CalPX Responds To FERC, Denies It Worsened Power Prices Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The chief executive officer of the California Power Exchange responded Tuesday to details in a federal energy regulatory report that suggests the two-year-old exchange's mandatory buy requirement was partly to blame for this past summer's soaring wholesale electricity prices. The details of the landmark probe prepared by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled to be released Wednesday morning, but some commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires the report will suggest that the state's mandatory buy rule should be abolished and utilities should be permitted to purchase their power through other power exchanges. \"We believe that the representation of the CalPX contributing to soaring wholesale prices is incorrect and misleading,\" said CalPX CEO George Sladoje. \"Over the summer months, certain wholesale market participants chose to not take full advantage of the price and cost mitigating products offered through the CalPX...if a participant chose to purchase all or most of their energy on the spot market, they often paid much more than other participants who chose to buy in the forwards market,\" Sladoje added. It is widely known in the wholesale electricity market that Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric Co. purchased most of their power in the spot market, which the utility passed on to its customers at a much higher price. SDG&E also complained to federal regulators that the CalPX hourly and day-ahead market clearing prices are too high. When California moved to electricity deregulation four years ago, a statewide power exchange was created requiring Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. to purchase all of their power through the exchange until 2002, the expected transition date to a completely deregulated market. But the FERC report proposes that utilities be permitted to purchase power from other exchanges in an effort to generate increased competition, commissioners said. The CalPX purchases power one day in advance for California's three investor-owned utilities. Suppliers bid in power indicating their price. For each hour of the next day, the price of the last megawatt taken to meet demand sets the market price. In various reports issued since 1996, FERC has commended the state's Power Exchange for running a successful market that helped mitigate concerns about market power abuses. If the FERC report suggests that California end the mandatory buy requirement, it will be up to state lawmakers to see to draft Legislation to change the market rules, according to the CalPX. -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 31-10-00\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

{"subject": "POWER POINTS: Skilling Moves On To Charities, Family", "body": "POWER POINTS: Skilling Moves On To Charities, Family By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Jeff Skilling will be spending the next few years working with charities in Houston and spending time with family, the former chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE) said in an interview. The 47-year-old Skilling, who resigned abruptly from Enron after the company's board meeting Aug. 14, repeatedly said he had left - as stated - for personal reasons. Wall Street has been skeptical of the explanation, and several analysts have said they're waiting for \"the other shoe to drop.\" The company's stock price fell 14% in response to the announcement last week - a loss of about $4.5 billion in shareholder value - and hasn't recovered this week. But the former chief executive said the stock price will recover once investors see that his departure isn't a precursor to more bad news for the company. \"I've spent the last 34 years working really hard,\" said Skilling, who requested the interview with Dow Jones Newswires. \"There are a lot of things that I haven't been doing - personal interests, spending time with family. There are a number of charitable things that I haven't spent the time on that I believe I should. I don't mean fundraising, but hands on, getting out and doing things, building houses, helping individuals.\" Skilling, who has been involved with a multiple sclerosis charity for years, said he plans to get involved in promoting the City of Houston. \"It's massively underrated as a place to work and live,\" he said. \"It's a great city, and I think I can do a lot to get that across.\" Though insistent that there is nothing more to his departure than personal reasons, Skilling said little to reveal why a talented executive would surrender the top spot of the country's largest energy trading company just six months after taking the job. Skilling had been Enron's No. 2 executive from 1997 until this year, and he's generally credited with the success of Enron's wholesale trading operations, which comprise about 80% of the parent's earnings. He confirmed there's no crisis in his family, and his health is fine. Skilling, who assumed the chief executive title on Feb. 12, also denied that he was suffering under the strain of the job. Late last week, Chairman Kenneth Lay and other Enron executives in New York told Wall Street analysts that Skilling had been going \"kind of nuts\" under the pressure of being chief executive, one analyst said. \"It's not true that I was cracking up,\" he said. \"Do I sound like someone who is cracking up? The representation of me as thick-skinned is a reasonable representation.\" When asked if his departure could have been handled more smoothly so as not to alarm investors, Skilling said that perhaps the mechanics could have been better, but said that is hindsight. \"We thought it through and thought we were going about it in the right way,\" he said. \"I don't know what we could have done differently. It will turn out, in retrospect, fine, as soon as people see that there's nothing else.\" About One Week's Notice The former chief executive totally disagreed with speculation in this column last week that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who immediately resumed the role of chief executive, may have wanted to regain day-to-day control of the company and pushed Skilling out. \"I think the world of Ken. You can't find a bigger fan of his than me,\" he said. \"I was not forced out. Personal and family reasons are 100% of the story. I guess it's kind of mundane, and I'm sorry it doesn't have as much drama and suspense as a lot of people would like it to have, but that's what the deal is.\" Skilling said he spoke with Lay about wanting to do other things many times over the years. The first serious discussion of his imminent departure came about a week before the announcement, said Skilling, whose recollection of his giving notice to Lay was somewhat cloudy. \"The board knew what was going on, and that was the point (the Aug. 1", "label": "phishing", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

(ENE) said in an interview. The 47-year-old Skilling, who resigned abruptly from Enron after the company's board meeting Aug. 14, repeatedly said he had left - as stated - for personal reasons. Wall Street has been skeptical of the explanation, and several analysts have said they're waiting for \"the other shoe to drop.\" The company's stock price fell 14% in response to the announcement last week - a loss of about $4.5 billion in shareholder value - and hasn't recovered this week. But the former chief executive said the stock price will recover once investors see that his departure isn't a precursor to more bad news for the company. \"I've spent the last 34 years working really hard,\" said Skilling, who requested the interview with Dow Jones Newswires. \"There are a lot of things that I haven't been doing - personal interests, spending time with family. There are a number of charitable things that I haven't spent the time on that I believe I should. I don't mean fundraising, but hands on, getting out and doing things, building houses, helping individuals.\" Skilling, who has been involved with a multiple sclerosis charity for years, said he plans to get involved in promoting the City of Houston. \"It's massively underrated as a place to work and live,\" he said. \"It's a great city, and I think I can do a lot to get that across.\" Though insistent that there is nothing more to his departure than personal reasons, Skilling said little to reveal why a talented executive would surrender the top spot of the country's largest energy trading company just six months after taking the job. Skilling had been Enron's No. 2 executive from 1997 until this year, and he's generally credited with the success of Enron's wholesale trading operations, which comprise about 80% of the parent's earnings. He confirmed there's no crisis in his family, and his health is fine. Skilling, who assumed the chief executive title on Feb. 12, also denied that he was suffering under the strain of the job. Late last week, Chairman Kenneth Lay and other Enron executives in New York told Wall Street analysts that Skilling had been going \"kind of nuts\" under the pressure of being chief executive, one analyst said. \"It's not true that I was cracking up,\" he said. \"Do I sound like someone who is cracking up? The representation of me as thick-skinned is a reasonable representation.\" When asked if his departure could have been handled more smoothly so as not to alarm investors, Skilling said that perhaps the mechanics could have been better, but said that is hindsight. \"We thought it through and thought we were going about it in the right way,\" he said. \"I don't know what we could have done differently. It will turn out, in retrospect, fine, as soon as people see that there's nothing else.\" About One Week's Notice The former chief executive totally disagreed with speculation in this column last week that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who immediately resumed the role of chief executive, may have wanted to regain day-to-day control of the company and pushed Skilling out. \"I think the world of Ken.

It's Steve Cooper. It's Friday afternoon, March 1. I hope everybody has had a great week. I want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week, so that you all will be fully in the loop. The week started in a rough-and-tumble fashion. I went to a town meeting Monday night to meet with a number of our ex-colleagues. Their disappointment, upset and anger is very understandable. I, along with the entire management team, have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues. In order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on, we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $5 million fund. We are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees. I wanted you to be aware of that. I really do appreciate and understand everybody's upset. Last Friday, February 22, we presented to the Creditors' Committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program. As can be expected, there was some push back from the committee -- there were issues about some of the data, there were requests for additional data and further clarification. The Creditors' Committee formed a subcommittee. We provided to them more data. Jeff McMahon and I met with them on Wednesday, February 27, and we met with them again on Thursday, February 28. We are scheduled to meet with them again on Monday and Tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the Creditors' Committee on this program. I have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is Jeff's and my highest priority. It is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future, their future compensation, and any financial safety net, so we are going to have to move on this at light speed. I told the creditors' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of March 11 to motion this up to the court. I'll keep you posted on progress. I am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs. Hopefully, by the time we have the employee meeting, we can walk through the composition of the program in detail. The powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions. Hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week. Then, the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases. And it works its way through the review, approval and communication process. So hopefully, we'll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases. We reached an accord with the Astros this week to repatriate to Enron $2.1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract. It is a shame we won't be in a position to support the naming of the field, but it is probably in the best interest of the estate. I got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning Enron Field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex-employees' fund. I'd like your input on that. I thought it was a great idea and very generous. We are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month. Hopefully I'll be able to meet many of you there.

{"subject": "Those germans!!!", "body": "Well our first week in our new office has been quite an experience. Armin is only in the office late at night, so I am up here on this hill all alone during the day, just me and Angus. On Monday a man came from some department of the government to \"control\" the office... he wanted to check that we have everything required by law for our employees. Since only the office is finished he kindly said he would come back in the fall, he was very nice. On Tuesday another man came from the government, once again to \"control\" the employees, same kind of stuff as the 1st man, just another branch of the government. Since only the office is finished he kindly said he would come back in the fall, he was very nice too. Both of these men showed me ID, even though it meant nothing to me. Then on Wednesday, there was loud knocking on the office door and I walked down the stairs to see about 15 MEN CONVERGING ON MY WHOLE BUILDING! They were all dressed in plain clothes, jeans and stuff, and had arrived in several dark colored cars and a white van. I opened the door and some of them came in. The one in charge spoke to me but I only understood the words customs and control the employees! They were looking everywhere and looking at me quite strangely. I was very uncomfortable not know WHO OR WHAT they were. When the leader realized that I spoke better English than German, he spoke to the others..\"ENGLISH!\" and then another one came from the rear and began questioning me in English. He wanted to know where the employees were, if I was alone, what I was doing...he then realized that there was a business working out this building and asked if it was mine, I QUICKLY said NO, IT'S MY HUSBANDS! He then wanted all the details about our buisness, what we did, how many employees etc. I was so puzzeled and he could see it. They all started smiling at each other then just said, this IS your address for the buisiness, Schleehofstr. 14? I said yes and he said OK, fine. Then, they all packed up and left. I didn't see or talk to Armin until he came home for lunch. I explained to him what had happened and he was shocked too. He said that's never happened to his business before. Then the more we talked about it, it began to become clear what they had really been there to do and why. Our building looks and is still very much under construction, even though no one but me is working here right now. But the company that built the structure still has their mobile office here and their workers meet here each morning before going in company trucks to their new jobsite, leaving their autos out front on the street. The men had been with the german immigration police. Someone must have called in that there were illegal aliens working at this address! When they arrived they saw all the cars and came in to carry off any illegals in there van that were working on the jobsite, they really had no interest in our buisiness or employees! So yes, I got raided on my 3rd day here in our new office. Armin said that they should have shown me some ID and never open the door again unless I see ID...LIKE GERMAN ID IS GOING TO MEAN ALOT TO ME THRU A GLASS DOOR?!?!? What an experience. So how's things going with you? I got the aol thing and will try to get that set up. But mostly when you are online at your house, I'm asleep. Write when you can!

{"subject": "Davis Eases Power Plant Pollution Rules", "body": "Tuesday, June 12, 2001 Davis Eases Power Plant Pollution Rules Electricity: Order will allow more production from heavily polluting 'peaker' facilities. By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis agreed Monday to lift air emission limits on heavily polluting power plants and allow them to run at capacity this summer as long as the electricity they produce is sold in the state. State officials said the plants must be pressed into use to avoid blackouts. Davis' executive order lets the generators build the cost of air pollution fines into the price the state pays for electricity produced by natural gas-fired power plants, said Catherine Witherspoon of the California Air Resources Board. Municipal utility districts--including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power--and independent power companies could supply as much as 1,200 megawatts from so-called peaker plants, facilities that generally are permitted to operate for only a few hundred hours a year because they pollute so heavily. That is enough power for more than 1 million homes. Other gas-fired power plants that have been shut down because of air pollution restrictions also could be started up as a result of the order. In a news conference Monday, state officials said the order will have the effect of lowering air pollution by limiting the use of far dirtier diesel generators, which industry could use if power supplies are threatened. \"If we don't get every last megawatt we can [from natural gas-fired plants],\" said Witherspoon of the air board, \"we will see people turning to diesel more frequently.\" Added Kellan Fluckiger, a top energy advisor to Davis: \"If you don't run these, you're either going to have outages or you're going to run something dirtier.\" Fluckiger said the order expands \"the number of hours these things can run and the amount of energy they can produce.\" New natural gas-fired power plants emit about half a pound per megawatt-hour of operation of ozone-producing pollutants. The plants affected by the order emit between two and five pounds of oxides of nitrogen per megawatt-hour. If the plants are pressed into operation for 200,000 megawatt-hours this summer, there will be between 400,000 and 1 million additional pounds of oxides of nitrogen emitted into the air. The state probably will end up paying the fees associated with the extra pollution through higher electricity prices. The fees amount to $7.50 per pound of oxides of nitrogen--or $7.5 million if the plants operate for 200,000 hours--and $1.10 per pound of carbon monoxide emissions. The money would be used to reduce air pollution from other sources. \"Under this order, dirty power plants can run as long as they want and pollute as much as they want so long as they pay into a fund,\" said Gail Ruderman Feuer, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. \"Our concern is that there's no guarantee that the fund will result in emission reductions any time soon.\" A Ventura County air pollution control official said that running one peaking power plant operated by Reliant Energy for one hour is the equivalent of adding 20,000 new cars to Ventura County highways for an hour. Reliant Energy could not be reached for comment Monday night. \"To the extent that they run when not needed for an emergency, it's going to put more air pollution into Ventura County skies and it's going to make our air dirtier,\" said Dick Baldwin, air pollution control officer for Ventura County. Los Angeles DWP Director David Wiggs hailed the order, saying it was needed so the city can sell the state as much as 1,000 megawatts of power this summer. \"This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of our excess capacity to the state,\" Wiggs said. He added, however, that the city and state have not yet agreed on a price for the power. Wiggs said the city is \"negotiating to get our cost as low as we can legally charge\" so that customers of the city utility district are not subsidizi", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

The fees amount to $7.50 per pound of oxides of nitrogen--or $7.5 million if the plants operate for 200,000 hours--and $1.10 per pound of carbon monoxide emissions. The money would be used to reduce air pollution from other sources. \"Under this order, dirty power plants can run as long as they want and pollute as much as they want so long as they pay into a fund,\" said Gail Ruderman Feuer, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. \"Our concern is that there's no guarantee that the fund will result in emission reductions any time soon.\" A Ventura County air pollution control official said that running one peaking power plant operated by Reliant Energy for one hour is the equivalent of adding 20,000 new cars to Ventura County highways for an hour. Reliant Energy could not be reached for comment Monday night. \"To the extent that they run when not needed for an emergency, it's going to put more air pollution into Ventura County skies and it's going to make our air dirtier,\" said Dick Baldwin, air pollution control officer for Ventura County. Los Angeles DWP Director David Wiggs hailed the order, saying it was needed so the city can sell the state as much as 1,000 megawatts of power this summer. \"This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of our excess capacity to the state,\" Wiggs said. He added, however, that the city and state have not yet agreed on a price for the power. Wiggs said the city is \"negotiating to get our cost as low as we can legally charge\" so that customers of the city utility district are not subsidizi\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others, overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity service. On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class action status and may be consolidated into one complaint. The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday morning in San Diego. Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold in the state. An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable to comment. The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices. The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Journalists in Califonia: -Werner Sturbeck (FAZ - Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung) -Werner Jaspert (S_ddeutsche Zeitung) -Dr. J_rgen Frech (WAZ - Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung -Jochen Schuster (Focus) Journalists that had been invited but refused: -Dr. Andreas Wildhagen (Wirtschaftswoche) -Hans-Willy Bein (Financial Times Deutschland) -Die Welt I also got the information that Ruhrgas held a press conference yesterday in California. So we can expect the first articles on California tomorrow or latest on Monday. I also will do an additional internet monitoring (for example WAZ, which we don't read daily) this afternoon to see if there are already some articles. We should recommend EFET to send their statement not only to those journalists who have been on the press trip but to all key contacts.

So we can expect the first articles on California tomorrow or latest on Monday. I also will do an additional internet monitoring (for example WAZ, which we don't read daily) this afternoon to see if there are already some articles. We should recommend EFET to send their statement not only to those journalists who have been on the press trip but to all key contacts.

We have helped them to find out which German journalists the German gas incumbent, Ruhrgas, has sent to California this week. We found out about that yesterday. I have now passed on that list + some general PR recommendations and EFET will now take the lead on this (they will send out an EFET position paper on California and have a spokesperson available especially for California - he's not Enron!). Just wanted to make sure you are aware because it could be possible that people will come to us for further comment. The general consensus now is that we then refer them to EFET.

Up to you now to send them the EFET position paper on California. Would suggest you try to get it on their desk by Monday morning latest, if possible. Would also send it to those who have refused to go and other key contacts we have given to you. Media seems to be keen to know EFET's position on this. Let me know if you need translation of the personalised note that will accompany the position paper. Obviously, we will divert any requests we get to you.

Thank you for generously offering to help us explore this connection. We believe there are strong synergies between Professor Bill Moomaw's International Environment and Resource Policy program and Enron's business model. There is currently a strong recruiting relationship between Enron and Fletcher; there are nine Fletcherites at Enron at this time. I'm confident that our strong recruiting relationship is a solid first step from which to launch an even stronger partnership. In order to explore expanding this relationship Ms. Elise Kalmans, Director of Community Development, agreed to arrange a meeting for Bill and me last spring. Unfortunately, the scheduling did not work out, and Ms. Kalmans then began a maternity leave so we had trouble identifying a new point of contact. I appreciate your suggestion that we aim to work through Stephen Kean. As Senior Vice President for Public and Environmental and Government Affairs, he does sound like the ideal contact with whom to discuss Professor Moomaw's program and its students. How do you suggest we proceed? Should we send a letter from Interim Dean Trachtman to ask if Mr. Kean would be willing to meet with Professor Moomaw? May I mention that you suggested we write him? At Betsy's suggestion, I have attached the presentation outline we prepared for Enron, along with the letter we originally mailed to Elise. I would be very interested in any suggestions you may have. If you have any trouble opening the powerpoint file or word document, please let me know and I would be happy to mail or fax them. Thank you again for your kind offer of assistance.

Lexmark International, Inc. MediaOne Group Inc. National Service Industries Inc. Raychem Corp Sundstrand Corp. Time Warner Inc US West Communications Inc.

Based on accounting entries in its Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA), PG&E says it completed recovery of its transition costs sometime before August 31, 2000, thus ending the rate freeze.? ? This advice letter and the accompanying?tariff changes?are said to be filed in compliance with D.00-06-034, D.00-03-058, and D.99-10-057 in the Post-Transition Electric Ratemaking (PTER) proceeding (A. 99-01-016).? However, I believe it conflicts directly with the end of the rate freeze mechanism which was specified in that proceeding.? ? The August date for ending the rate freeze is based on the valuation of PG&E\u0001, s retained hydro assets of $2.8 billion, as included in the Company\u0001,s Generation Asset Balancing Account (\"GABA\") filing effective June 23, 2000 as filed in Advice Letters 2048-E and 2049-E, dated October 26, 2000.? Based on current market conditions PG&E believes the actual value will be determined to be higher than $2.8 billion.? If this is the case, the rate freeze will have ended earlier and the tariffs contained herein will be revised.? If the actual value of such generation is lawfully determined to be lower, PG&E says it will not seek recovery of any resulting undercollected CTC. ? This should be protested as it is an obvious effort to get out from under their current purchased power undercollections at the expense of their ratepayers, by making a spurious claim that the rate freeze has ended.? There is no date specified for comments, but assuming the usual 20 days, that means protests are due on December 12. ?

Reply with only the label.\n### Email:\nSubject: Fwd: PG&E Advice Letter 2057-E\nBody: Yesterday, PG&E sent out by email?the attached?advice letter filed last Wednesday, 2057-E, which proposes to?implement revisions to all electric rate schedules and preliminary statements to change the Company\u0001,s rates and to bill customers based on PG&E\u0001,s flawed contention that the AB 1890 rate freeze has ended.? Based on accounting entries in its Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA), PG&E says it completed recovery of its transition costs sometime before August 31, 2000, thus ending the rate freeze.? ? This advice letter and the accompanying?tariff changes?are said to be filed in compliance with D.00-06-034, D.00-03-058, and D.99-10-057 in the Post-Transition Electric Ratemaking (PTER) proceeding (A. 99-01-016).? However, I believe it conflicts directly with the end of the rate freeze mechanism which was specified in that proceeding.? ? The August date for ending the rate freeze is based on the valuation of PG&E\u0001, s retained hydro assets of $2.8 billion, as included in the Company\u0001,s Generation Asset Balancing Account (\"GABA\") filing effective June 23, 2000 as filed in Advice Letters 2048-E and 2049-E, dated October 26, 2000.? Based on current market conditions PG&E believes the actual value will be determined to be higher than $2.8 billion.? If this is the case, the rate freeze will have ended earlier and the tariffs contained herein will be revised.? If the actual value of such generation is lawfully determined to be lower, PG&E says it will not seek recovery of any resulting undercollected CTC. ? This should be protested as it is an obvious effort to get out from under their current purchased power undercollections at the expense of their ratepayers, by making a spurious claim that the rate freeze has ended.? There is no date specified for comments, but assuming the usual 20 days, that means protests are due on December 12. ?

{"subject": "Energy Issue -- Pt. 2", "body": "These articles appeared in the editorial section of the Sacramento Bee: The inside story of why PG&E went bankrupt: Top officials of the huge utility say they didn't think Sacramento could fix their problem. (Published April 22, 2001) On April 13, a week after Pacific Gas & Electric filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Gordon R. Smith, president and chief executive officer of the utility, and Dan Richard, vice president for public affairs, met with The Bee's editorial board. What follows are edited excerpts from the interview: Bee: Why don't we start with a single-word question -- why? Gordon Smith: Why did we file Chapter 11 [bankruptcy] a week ago today? In all sincerity, it was the right venue for trying to resolve the financial energy crisis facing our company. It's a means to get somewhere else from where we were before or where we are now. There have been a lot of statements over the last 10 months now that we've been looking for a bailout. I think even the [Southern California] Edison agreement reached with the governor has been viewed by some as a bailout. We never viewed it as a bailout. What we really wanted was the state Public Utilities Commission to follow the law to determine the end of the rate freeze, to give a valuation of our hydro [electric] facilities and after that, pass on the costs of wholesale power costs to our customers. It's not our power costs. It's our customers' power costs. And, in fact, the PUC in the last several weeks and months has been issuing destabilizing orders to us. You probably saw two and a half weeks ago that they announced a 3-cent kilowatt-hour increase, which is described as somewhere between a 40 and 47 percent rate increase. None of that money in fact stopped with financially troubled PG&E. It went right onto the state. In fact, as we read their orders, there was even more than that coming out of our treasury to go to the state. That, along with a few other orders, just said we needed to take a look at a different venue. Chapter 11 appeared to be the best one. Dan Richard: I think we really did lose faith that there was going to be a solution coming out of the political process. And I have to tell you, people in Sacramento were saying to me, \"We don't believe there's the political will to fix this problem.\" It was kind of startling. But there were a number of leaders who were saying, \"We don't think you're going to get there.\" And we didn't think we were going to get there. Bee: What is your evaluation of the Edison deal? Smith: Well, I think our press release said we're delighted. We're happy to see that they've reached a conclusion. We're still evaluating it to see what is in it and what isn't in it, and whether or not it might be a framework for a settlement. Bee: The conventional wisdom I'm hearing is that Edison pretty much got everything that it wanted. A lot of people were asking if that deal was on the table a week before, why would PG&E not have taken it? Smith: I don't think that deal -- and I'm speculating here so forgive me -- was on the table the week before for Edison. Bee: How about for you? Smith: I would speculate that our actions last Friday spurred people to work around the clock over the weekend and for an announcement on Monday. Richard: I think the governor actually said almost those very words. Bee: You think he gave them a better deal to prevent them from going to bankruptcy? Smith: Absolutely. Yeah. Bee: What's not to like about that proposal from a utility point of view? Smith: We were prepared to accept many of the terms that the governor outlined in his televised speech a week ago last night.

There have been a lot of statements over the last 10 months now that we've been looking for a bailout. I think even the [Southern California] Edison agreement reached with the governor has been viewed by some as a bailout. We never viewed it as a bailout. What we really wanted was the state Public Utilities Commission to follow the law to determine the end of the rate freeze, to give a valuation of our hydro [electric] facilities and after that, pass on the costs of wholesale power costs to our customers. It's not our power costs. It's our customers' power costs. And, in fact, the PUC in the last several weeks and months has been issuing destabilizing orders to us. You probably saw two and a half weeks ago that they announced a 3-cent kilowatt-hour increase, which is described as somewhere between a 40 and 47 percent rate increase. None of that money in fact stopped with financially troubled PG&E. It went right onto the state. In fact, as we read their orders, there was even more than that coming out of our treasury to go to the state. That, along with a few other orders, just said we needed to take a look at a different venue. Chapter 11 appeared to be the best one. Dan Richard: I think we really did lose faith that there was going to be a solution coming out of the political process. And I have to tell you, people in Sacramento were saying to me, \"We don't believe there's the political will to fix this problem.\" It was kind of startling. But there were a number of leaders who were saying, \"We don't think you're going to get there.\" And we didn't think we were going to get there. Bee: What is your evaluation of the Edison deal? Smith: Well, I think our press release said we're delighted. We're happy to see that they've reached a conclusion. We're still evaluating it to see what is in it and what isn't in it, and whether or not it might be a framework for a settlement. Bee: The conventional wisdom I'm hearing is that Edison pretty much got everything that it wanted. A lot of people were asking if that deal was on the table a week before, why would PG&E not have taken it? Smith: I don't think that deal -- and I'm speculating here so forgive me -- was on the table the week before for Edison. Bee: How about for you? Smith: I would speculate that our actions last Friday spurred people to work around the clock over the weekend and for an announcement on Monday. Richard: I think the governor actually said almost those very words. Bee: You think he gave them a better deal to prevent them from going to bankruptcy? Smith: Absolutely. Yeah. Bee: What's not to like about that proposal from a utility point of view? Smith: We were prepared to accept many of the terms that the governor outlined in his televised speech a week ago last night. There were things that we wanted to have in that agreement that never appeared to show up in a written agreement. Bee: What was PG&E's comfort level with selling either its transmission or its hydro to the state? Smith: Well, it's a Sophie's choice for us. Part of the company was based on our hydro system and our transmission system. In order to stem off w\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

To the extent (and only to the extent) that a purchase is not otherwise paid by any party or payable by another party meeting the credit standards set forth in the ISO Tariff (another \"Qualified Party\"), DWR will assume financial responsibility for all purchases by the ISO in its ancillary services and imbalance energy markets based on bids or other offers determined to be reasonable. Such determination of reasonableness will be made by DWR on a case by case basis and communicated to the ISO.

I hope you find it informative and more importantly, that you will use this newsletter to help spread the word about the successes in your group. To provide content for future e-mails, contact Michelle Vitrella in our Public Relations group via e-mail or call her at ext. 3-9767. Communication is one of the core Enron values and I believe this is a great way to improve communication across our wholesale businesses. Additionally, I would like to again encourage everyone to take a few minutes to complete \u0001&The Pulse\u00018 survey. This annual survey regarding the work experience at Enron and how we can make it better is an important part of the two-way communication process at Enron. Please go to the Enron intranet and type survey.enron.com. It only takes a few minutes, it\u0001,s confidential and your comments will help make Enron a better place to work. BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Natural Gas Middle Marketing\u0001,s biggest trade of the year so far occurred this month. The significant transaction was a five year, multimillion dollar restructuring with a subsidiary of Formosa Plastics, one of the world\u0001,s largest producers of polyvinyl chloride. Additionally, Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, has hedged a considerable amount (1.2 million barrels/month) of crude oil. Winter Nymex hedges were put in place for the undisputed heavyweight chip champ of the world, Frito Lay. Pulp & Paper With the acquisition of Garden State Paper and launch of Clickpaper.com, Enron is creating an efficient spot physical market for pulp and paper commodities. Buyers and sellers will benefit from improved price transparency and reliability and access to Enron\u0001,s online financial markets. Improved price transparency and the ability to imbed financial derivatives into physical trading flows will facilitate the growth of Enron\u0001,s trading business. To date, Clickpaper.com has traded over 1 millions tons of pulp and paper product with a notional value of over $675 million. Upstream Origination Upstream Origination, headed by Julie Gomez and Jean Mrha, focuses on natural gas products to optimize commercial value associated with the natural gas grid on the continent and in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Through products such as storage, electric compression and producer services & outsourcing, ENA creates value for its customers and reconfigures the natural gas infrastructure to be more efficient. In addition, Upstream Origination transactions exploit the unique relationship between development of strategic assets through sophisticated financing structures and the utilization of the market information created by those assets. \u0001&THE PULSE\u00018 SURVEY RESULTS As of Wednesday, October 18, the total responses to \u0001&The Pulse\u00018 from ENA/EGM/EIM are 689.

From: ENA Public Relations @ ENRON 10/19/2000 08:25 PM Sent by: Enron Announcements@ENRON To: All_ENA_EGM_EIM cc: Subject: Ameriflash Newsletter NOTE FROM MARK FREVERT With the wide and varied activities of our three organizations, we created this e-mail newsletter to keep everyone better informed about our various businesses. I hope you find it informative and more importantly, that you will use this newsletter to help spread the word about the successes in your group. To provide content for future e-mails, contact Michelle Vitrella in our Public Relations group via e-mail or call her at ext. 3-9767. Communication is one of the core Enron values and I believe this is a great way to improve communication across our wholesale businesses. Additionally, I would like to again encourage everyone to take a few minutes to complete \u0001&The Pulse\u00018 survey. This annual survey regarding the work experience at Enron and how we can make it better is an important part of the two-way communication process at Enron. Please go to the Enron intranet and type survey.enron.com. It only takes a few minutes, it\u0001,s confidential and your comments will help make Enron a better place to work. BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Natural Gas Middle Marketing\u0001,s biggest trade of the year so far occurred this month. The significant transaction was a five year, multimillion dollar restructuring with a subsidiary of Formosa Plastics, one of the world\u0001,s largest producers of polyvinyl chloride. Additionally, Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, has hedged a considerable amount (1.2 million barrels/month) of crude oil. Winter Nymex hedges were put in place for the undisputed heavyweight chip champ of the world, Frito Lay. Pulp & Paper With the acquisition of Garden State Paper and launch of Clickpaper.com, Enron is creating an efficient spot physical market for pulp and paper commodities. Buyers and sellers will benefit from improved price transparency and reliability and access to Enron\u0001,s online financial markets. Improved price transparency and the ability to imbed financial derivatives into physical trading flows will facilitate the growth of Enron\u0001,s trading business. To date, Clickpaper.com has traded over 1 millions tons of pulp and paper product with a notional value of over $675 million. Upstream Origination Upstream Origination, headed by Julie Gomez and Jean Mrha, focuses on natural gas products to optimize commercial value associated with the natural gas grid on the continent and in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Through products such as storage, electric compression and producer services & outsourcing, ENA creates value for its customers and reconfigures the natural gas infrastructure to be more efficient. In addition, Upstream Origination transactions exploit the unique relationship between development of strategic assets through sophisticated financing structures and the utilization of the market information created by those assets. \u0001&THE PULSE\u00018 SURVEY RESULTS As of Wednesday, October 18, the total responses to \u0001&The Pulse\u00018 from ENA/EGM/EIM are 689. This is approximately 30% of all employees. Since our goal is a 100% response rate, we have a long way to go! Please take a fe\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

The PUC said the company must agree to increase certain penalties from $5,000 to $25,000.

Dear Mr. Lay, Further to my emails dated 22/2/2000 & 14/6/2000 introducing Tata Housing as a premium real estate developer in India, and specifically, our commercial complex Technopolis KnowledgePark at Andheri (E), Mumbai. We have been given to understand that Enron have acquired an additional space in Kamla Mills Compound. We were surprised to note that Enron did not consider Technopolis KnowledgePark inspite of it being a ready to move in building with all the facilities required for a good Call Center. A few of these facilities being - ?High speed (100 MBPS) data network with switched interconnection between offices. ?Provision for ISDN lines. ?5000 line MTNL exchange on campus ?Power from Tata Electric Cos, which is 20% cheaper than the Government supply. ?In addition, a good quality restaurant and 24 hours ATM facility. ?Central Air-conditioning & Building Automation System. All these facilities and more were explained to Mr. Edward de Valcourt, Project Director Communications, Enron Corp., when he visited Technopolis KnowledgePark on 16/6/2000. Inspite of that, we have once again not been considered. I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that we currently have approximately 1,00,000 sq.ft. of space available at Technopolis KnowledgePark. We are also in the process of constructing the IInd Phase in the same complex which is approximately 60,000 sq.ft. and can be made entirely available to you, if required. Further, we have another building of approximately 1,00,000 sq.ft. located strategically at Kanjurmarg. This too could be ideal for your requirement. We would also like to inform you that Tata Housing has a large land bank and can offer properties to Enron for Call Centres across the country.

In order to accommodate the deletion of 9(b), we recommend revising your number 6 to read as follows: 6. Substitution (a) Paragraph 9(b) is hereby deleted in its entirety. (b) Seller shall not retain custody of any Purchased Securities under any Transaction governed by this Agreement. NOTICES: Your suggested language regarding notices is potentially problematic. Under the Paragraph 13 of the MRA, notices may made orally, \"to be confirmed promptly in writing....\", and confirmation of delivery is not expressly relevant. The unquestionable ability to make oral margin calls pursuant to Paragraph 4 is vital in fast-moving market conditions, and was expressly included in the standard agreement to avoid any doubt as to their validity. In the default context (Paragraph 11), proof of delivery of written notice is of no concern because the exercise of a party's rights under that Paragraph is not contingent upon delivery of notice. Notice must be given \"as promptly as practicable.\" We believe that the proposed language could cause confusion or uncertainty regarding the validity of oral margin calls and would conflict with the operative provisions of Paragraph 11. We therefore request deletion of your number 8. NON-ASSIGNABILITY: As we discussed earlier today, we have a general aversion to assignments of repurchase transactions due to our regulatory obligations as a broker-dealers. For that reason, we must be free to withhold consent to assignment with confidence that such withholding will not be challenged as \"unreasonable.\" We therefore request deletion of your number 9. We are still reviewing your proposals regarding SETOFF and LIMITED LIABILITY. I will also have to review Section 5-1401 of the NYGOL before commenting on that.

All of them (NGX, OM, Enerdata and Zarzeczny) have agreed (with the exception of Westcoast, who is not really relevant and who sold out their position in NGX to OM after commencement of the litigation). By its terms, we have until Friday to confirm our agreement. The key terms are: 1. EOL third-party transaction data will be included in the index on a real-time basis; 2. Other electronic trading systems may have their data included in the index if they meet the criteria for inclusion (similar product, audit rights) (i.e. we deleted the \"most favour nations\" requirement for inclusion of other systems not being on more favourable terms); 3. Enron pays a one-time C$25,000 set-up fee; 4. Enron pays an index management fee of C$5,000 per month, unless Enron trades at least 50,000 TJ\u0001,s per month on NGX; 6. Enron pays normal NGX trading fees; 7. Enron pays no audit fees or other fees or costs; 8. Lawsuit is released with everybody bearing their own costs; 9. Enron agrees to confidential audit rights to independent auditor \u0001) but no customer information is provided to NGX; 10. No non-compete.

Term is 3 years, commencing after information transfer systems are in place, but not later than Dec. 31 (failing which lawsuit is revived, but against NGX only); 12. Enron can terminate at any time on 60 days notice (but lawsuit is released); 13. Enron can terminate at any time for NGX breach (lawsuit is revived, but against NGX only); 14. NGX can change its products and Enron has the option to change and be included or not to change; 15. The method for calculating and compiling the index cannot be changed in the future without our approval, and the agreements between NGX and Enerdata which give NGX the rights to the index cannot be amended or terminated without our consent; 16.

{"subject": "Methane Artic Discharge 2/12-13", "body": "FYI ---------------------- Forwarded by Todd Peterson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 02/14/2001 10:31 AM --------------------------- Larry Snyder@EES 02/13/2001 09:57 AM To: Rick Sierra/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc: Victor Vega/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Todd Peterson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Wayne Perry/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Jaime Banchs/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Methane Artic Discharge 2/12-13 The discharge of the LNG cargo was sucessfully completed this morning at approximately 5:30 AM. The ship sailed at around 9 AM today. Below are the highlights of discharge. At around 1:20 AM the UPS system (Uninterruptible Power Supply system) failed causing loss of power to alarm and control system. This activated ESD and unloading was safely shutdown with no problems. It took approximately 2 hours to identify the UPS system as the problem, bypass the UPS so power was supplied directly from line (not through UPS) and restart pumps to full rate unloading. Bypassing UPS only required throwing switch to line setting as system is set up to accommodate problems with UPS. Eco will investigation the UPS system to correct the problem. Eco had planned on loading liquid nitrogen (LN2) to the ship before cargo discharge started. Eco had a preliminary procedure they had prepared for LN2 loading. Coast Guard had not reviewed a procedure for LN2 loading so wanted staff to review the document before LN2 loading. It was agreed LNG unloading would proceed and LN2 loading would occur after cargo discharge was completed. A copy of procedure was sent to Coast Guard's San Juan office for staff review. Within 2 hours the Coast Guard had approved loading the liquid nitrogen after the cargo discharge was completed. Eco will prepare an official procedure and submit it to the Coast Guard as an addition to the procedures previously submitted. Eco had pre-cooled the LN2 line in preparation for loading onto the ship. The line was allowed to warm up and cooldown occurred the next morning (13th) during the cargo ratedown. Once the last cargo pump was shutdown the loading of LN2 began. The LN2 transfer went very slowly. The Methane Artic used a 1 and 1/2 inch stainless hose to connect Eco's loading line to ship's manifold. Eco's line is a 3\". It was obvious the ship was in a hurry so they decided that after increasing the level in one of its' two tanks by approx. 11% that they had enough LN2 and ceased the loading operation. Disconnection of the vapor and LN2 lines were completed and the ship sailed shortly thereafter. The ship loaded very little LN2 and obviously didn't really need much although they were low (only 29% in one tank). There were several minor leaks at flanges in the LN2 loading system. Leaks were small and nitrogen safe so loading was not stopped for warming up line and tightening the bolts. These leaks were identified and flanges will be tightened during the next week. With the problems of the UPS failure the operators forgot to shutdown the sample collection system. This will probably result in a bad composite sample. I have already discussed with Victor Vega the need to have a person only follow the LNG sample collection and analysis during the entire period of the cargo discharge. They would have no other responsibility. I had previous had discussion with the Eco chemist Luz regarding a testing program to take place after this discharge to give additional support to prove the sample system works. I will follow up this week to ensure test takes place within the next week. I will need Eco's management support with scheduling this. ---------------------- Forwarded by Todd Peterson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 02/14/2001 10:31 AM --------------------------- Larry Snyder@EES 02/13/2001 11:10 AM To: Rick Sierra/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc: Victor Vega/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Todd Peterson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Wayne Perry/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Jaime Ba", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

{"subject": "Re: Global Case", "body": "Thanks. I'll soften the expropriation language. I don't think they can disclose the $1 million on the product liability case, since the entire package appears to be one negotation, all the pieces of which likely have to be agreed to, or no settlement. But you're point's well taken and I'll try to acount for it in the answer. Finally, I can't see disclosing the fact that I'm infringing on someone's patent in my annual report. Seems like I'd have a hard time defending myself in court if they sued me, if I'd admitted it to it in my annual report. If I don't see you tomorrow, have a good week. Christine Piesco <christine.piesco@oracle.com> 11/26/2000 05:10 PM To: Jeff.Dasovich@enron.com cc: Subject: Re: Global Case Jeff, Sorry, I didn't realize we were attacking this one early over the holiday, and I was out of town until this afternoon. My conclusions differed from the attached write up on a few points, but I am not certain my thinking is the correct way. Here goes: On the expropriation: In the write up we say \"We agree with the executive that Global should report the expropriation contingency in its 1994 report since both conditions included in FASB #5 were met: 1) sufficient information to assess that a loss is probable and 2) the loss could be reasonably estimated. Matuto took power in 1994 and it was known that he would nationalize major industries. \" The book says \"The imminence of an expropriation may be indicated by a public or private declaration of intent by a government to expropriate assess of the enterprise or actual expropriation of assets of other enterpises.\" I would argue that Matuto was not the government and therefore unable to enforce these assertions when he was running for office. It also says FASB 5 requires the two accrual criteria to be met. As I understand it, the government took over sometime last year and nationalization of resources was part of their platform. However, the announcement occured in mid-Feb 1995 that the government intends to nationalize the mining industry. Also, the taking over of the telephone company took place in January. Since both of these events happened in 1995, I would think they should not accrue in 1994 because the asset was not actually impaired in 1994, in fact the asset was fully functional and operational for the entire financial reporting period. I believe they should disclose that the possibility of expropriation exists in 1994, but I think they should not accrue..

My conclusions differed from the attached write up on a few points, but I am not certain my thinking is the correct way. Here goes: On the expropriation: In the write up we say \"We agree with the executive that Global should report the expropriation contingency in its 1994 report since both conditions included in FASB #5 were met: 1) sufficient information to assess that a loss is probable and 2) the loss could be reasonably estimated. Matuto took power in 1994 and it was known that he would nationalize major industries. \" The book says \"The imminence of an expropriation may be indicated by a public or private declaration of intent by a government to expropriate assess of the enterprise or actual expropriation of assets of other enterpises.\" I would argue that Matuto was not the government and therefore unable to enforce these assertions when he was running for office. It also says FASB 5 requires the two accrual criteria to be met. As I understand it, the government took over sometime last year and nationalization of resources was part of their platform. However, the announcement occured in mid-Feb 1995 that the government intends to nationalize the mining industry. Also, the taking over of the telephone company took place in January. Since both of these events happened in 1995, I would think they should not accrue in 1994 because the asset was not actually impaired in 1994, in fact the asset was fully functional and operational for the entire financial reporting period. I believe they should disclose that the possibility of expropriation exists in 1994, but I think they should not accrue..

FYI. To view the entire article, go to http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32756-2001Jun6.html Steel Lobbyists Gain the Edge In persuading President Bush, a self-proclaimed free trader, to take steps this week aimed at restricting imports of steel, lobbyists for the U.S. steel industry used the threat that thousands of retired steelworkers in key states would lose their health insurance if their companies closed. The specter of an uprising by steel retirees, who substantially outnumber active steelworkers, provided a potent political argument for the industry's case that Bush should take drastic action to protect U.S. steel companies from a worldwide glut even at the cost of tarnishing his free-trade image. The argument was advanced by two top Republican lobbyists, Edward W. Gillespie and Vin Weber, each of whom has been receiving $45,0! 00! a month from an industry-union coalition called Stand Up for Steel. The coalition scored a smashing victory Tuesday, when Bush announced that his administration will file a case with the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to win authority to set quotas on steel imports. And although many factors went into the White House's decision, industry sources and other participants pointed to the concerns raised by Gillespie and Weber as a classic demonstration of how a highly motivated constituency can sway an administration that barely won the electoral college and lost the popular vote. \"From a political perspective, this was not a hard case to make to a government as closely divided as this one is,\" said Weber, a former congressman, in an interview. Eighteen steel companies are \"in one stage or another of bankruptcy. All those retirees are facing loss of benefits.\" Only about 150,000 people now work in U.S. steel facilities, but at some of the biggest integrated steel! ma! kers -- which are in the worst trouble financially -- there are about six retirees for every active worker. (The total number of retirees is slightly more than 300,000, according to industry officials). Adding to the political punch behind the Gillespie-Weber argument was the fact that many of these retirees live in Rust Belt states that were hotly contested in the last presidential election, including Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio and West Virginia. The most fiercely contested state of all -- Florida -- is among the top eight states in number of retirees. A lobbyist who worked against the steel industry, Lewis Leibowitz of the law firm Hogan & Hartson, ruefully gave credit to his opponents' political skill. Leibowitz represents the Consumer Industry Trade Action Coalition, which consists of companies that favor free trade on the grounds that import competition helps keep costs low. \"They did a lot, obviously,\" Leibowitz said, referring to Gillespie and Weber. \"This is an! i! ndustry that has something like 160,000 workers, and the market [value] of all the companies is smaller than that of Amazon.com, and they've turned this town upside down. So my hat is off to them.\" The administration took other considerations into account, to be sure, including the need to win support from steel state Democrats for congressional authority to negotiate new trade agreements. Jim Dyke, a spokesman for Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, asserted that his boss was particularly moved by the pleas of union leaders who recalled how their companies had shed workers and restructured in the 1980s only to find themselves devastated anew by imports. Foreign steel shipments, which account for about 20 percent of the U.S. market, reached record levels after financial crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil in the late 1990s. \"Factories are closing, and people are losing their jobs, because there's not a level playing field,\" Dyke said, repeating the administration's argument! t! hat a major reason for the oversuppl", "label": "phishing", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

The coalition scored a smashing victory Tuesday, when Bush announced that his administration will file a case with the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to win authority to set quotas on steel imports. And although many factors went into the White House's decision, industry sources and other participants pointed to the concerns raised by Gillespie and Weber as a classic demonstration of how a highly motivated constituency can sway an administration that barely won the electoral college and lost the popular vote. \"From a political perspective, this was not a hard case to make to a government as closely divided as this one is,\" said Weber, a former congressman, in an interview. Eighteen steel companies are \"in one stage or another of bankruptcy. All those retirees are facing loss of benefits.\" Only about 150,000 people now work in U.S. steel facilities, but at some of the biggest integrated steel! ma! kers -- which are in the worst trouble financially -- there are about six retirees for every active worker. (The total number of retirees is slightly more than 300,000, according to industry officials). Adding to the political punch behind the Gillespie-Weber argument was the fact that many of these retirees live in Rust Belt states that were hotly contested in the last presidential election, including Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio and West Virginia. The most fiercely contested state of all -- Florida -- is among the top eight states in number of retirees. A lobbyist who worked against the steel industry, Lewis Leibowitz of the law firm Hogan & Hartson, ruefully gave credit to his opponents' political skill. Leibowitz represents the Consumer Industry Trade Action Coalition, which consists of companies that favor free trade on the grounds that import competition helps keep costs low. \"They did a lot, obviously,\" Leibowitz said, referring to Gillespie and Weber. \"This is an! i! ndustry that has something like 160,000 workers, and the market [value] of all the companies is smaller than that of Amazon.com, and they've turned this town upside down. So my hat is off to them.\" The administration took other considerations into account, to be sure, including the need to win support from steel state Democrats for congressional authority to negotiate new trade agreements. Jim Dyke, a spokesman for Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, asserted that his boss was particularly moved by the pleas of union leaders who recalled how their companies had shed workers and restructured in the 1980s only to find themselves devastated anew by imports. Foreign steel shipments, which account for about 20 percent of the U.S. market, reached record levels after financial crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil in the late 1990s. \"Factories are closing, and people are losing their jobs, because there's not a level playing field,\" Dyke said, repeating the administration's argument! t! hat a major reason for the oversuppl\n### Response:\nphishing", "input": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

FYI. To view the entire article, go to http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32756-2001Jun6.html Steel Lobbyists Gain the Edge In persuading President Bush, a self-proclaimed free trader, to take steps this week aimed at restricting imports of steel, lobbyists for the U.S. steel industry used the threat that thousands of retired steelworkers in key states would lose their health insurance if their companies closed. The specter of an uprising by steel retirees, who substantially outnumber active steelworkers, provided a potent political argument for the industry's case that Bush should take drastic action to protect U.S. steel companies from a worldwide glut even at the cost of tarnishing his free-trade image. The argument was advanced by two top Republican lobbyists, Edward W. Gillespie and Vin Weber, each of whom has been receiving $45,0! 00! a month from an industry-union coalition called Stand Up for Steel. The coalition scored a smashing victory Tuesday, when Bush announced that his administration will file a case with the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to win authority to set quotas on steel imports.

We appreciate your initial support of the system and would like to solicit your input on some system details that will be custom to the Corp. deployment and may be used eventually for other business units' standards. Bob Butts has approved the following request limits for Corp. Accounting, and we need to get your \"OK\" as well for implementation. Please call me at x33896 if you have any questions or would like to discuss this proposal. Request limits: The system allows setup of graduated dollar limits for order amounts based on job classification, which are listed below, with some examples of items that might fit within each limit. Requests with totals below these limits would flow through the system without any further authorization required. Exceptions to these levels can be made on an individual basis, and those individuals will be identified as we get closer to implementation. Level 1 Clerks/Sr. Clerks $250 Routine office supplies, beverages, pager, computer keyboard Level 2 Admins/Specialists $500 Small furniture, larger supply orders, palm pilot Level 3 Sr. Specialist $5,00 Computer, fax machine, furniture Level 4 Manager $25,000 Level 5 Director/Sr. Director $100,000 Level 6 Vice President $250,000 Level 7 Managing Director $500,000 Level 8 EVP $1.0M Please note that these amounts fall within the Enron standards for invoice approval authority. In our meetings with Stakeholders and Change Agents, we got a clear message that lower ordering authorization was preferable. Approval Flow: The system allows approval flow to be customized to each department. For example, Public Affairs could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to flow first to an Admin for approval, then to a Sr. Specialist or higher for final issuance. The Accounting department could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to go directly to a Director for the first level of approval. Under the limits proposed below, a $650 request by a Sr. Specialist would not be routed, as it would fall under the specified ordering authorized level. As we get closer to the implementation date, we will work with the designated Stakeholders to design the approval flow for your departments. Controls: As with any system, a concentrated effort can bypass built-in controls. As a control mechanism, we've proposed that SAP generate a periodic report so that cost center owners can conveniently track ordering activity. The team is working on the best way to generate and deliver this report. I appreciate your \"OK\" on the above, or any feedback you might have.

With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.

I had you on my \"To Do\" list today to follow-up from our conversation last week. I appreciate your responses, and will follow-up as needed. Just to recap EIM's current inititives. PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) was engaged in 10/00 to develop a business plan for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical business. In 11/00, AA was engaged to develop a \"Blueprint\" of EIM major processes (Deal Execution, Deal Capture, Risk Management, Logistics, Settlements and Financial Reporting), down to level 2 processes. The initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the \"Blueprint\", a gap analysis of Enron systems to business needs and recommended systems. A complete \"roadmap\" should be laid out with a 0-3months, 4-6months, 7-9 months and 10-12months timeline. The plan addresses tactical also. Our overall objective: Build an infrastructure (people, processes and systems) that is scalable and supports the trading business of EIM. The current industries are Forest Products and Steel. However, additional industries may be added. The targeted infrastructure would require little change to support new industries. The delieverable is expected by the end of 2/01. We'd be happy to visit with you all (video conference or Houston,....) to give you more information. Let me know how to proceed. Thanks again for your time. Since I wasn't able to attend the Controllers' Conference last 10/00, I'm glad I got to meet you last week. Stay in touch. Brenda To: Brenda F Herod/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT, Paul Wallace/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Metals Brenda As discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality between Enron Metals and EIM that should allow leverage off common goals. In particular I promised info on a few areas: Project Q assessment A lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to Enron Metals (being to do with interfaces with our AS400 ysstem) however high level issues which formed part of the decision to not develop this for Enron metals were: Q is over specified for metals. Traffic / logistics for metals is less complex than oil & coal. Metals process tends towards Buy>Store>Sell whereas for liquids the storage is not as prevelant Metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship/barge 2. Inventory Controls Again the reports produced here have been very specific to Enron Metals. Paul Wallace a manager in the co-ordination function is working extensively on developing the controls in this area. I would suggest that you contact Paul directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in general. 3. Funding of inventory We have a structured finance facility here in London. The deal is specific to Enron Metals markets in that it works by reference to LME prices as these are the base index for all the positions placed in the facility. If structured financing is sort for EIM then it would be appropriate to talk to either David Tregar (Metals Commercial) or Bill Appleby (Global Finance) as an intro to the issues faced. 4. Curve Management Process The markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quali", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

In 11/00, AA was engaged to develop a \"Blueprint\" of EIM major processes (Deal Execution, Deal Capture, Risk Management, Logistics, Settlements and Financial Reporting), down to level 2 processes. The initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the \"Blueprint\", a gap analysis of Enron systems to business needs and recommended systems. A complete \"roadmap\" should be laid out with a 0-3months, 4-6months, 7-9 months and 10-12months timeline. The plan addresses tactical also. Our overall objective: Build an infrastructure (people, processes and systems) that is scalable and supports the trading business of EIM. The current industries are Forest Products and Steel. However, additional industries may be added. The targeted infrastructure would require little change to support new industries. The delieverable is expected by the end of 2/01. We'd be happy to visit with you all (video conference or Houston,....) to give you more information. Let me know how to proceed. Thanks again for your time. Since I wasn't able to attend the Controllers' Conference last 10/00, I'm glad I got to meet you last week. Stay in touch. Brenda To: Brenda F Herod/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT, Paul Wallace/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Metals Brenda As discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality between Enron Metals and EIM that should allow leverage off common goals. In particular I promised info on a few areas: Project Q assessment A lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to Enron Metals (being to do with interfaces with our AS400 ysstem) however high level issues which formed part of the decision to not develop this for Enron metals were: Q is over specified for metals. Traffic / logistics for metals is less complex than oil & coal. Metals process tends towards Buy>Store>Sell whereas for liquids the storage is not as prevelant Metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship/barge 2. Inventory Controls Again the reports produced here have been very specific to Enron Metals. Paul Wallace a manager in the co-ordination function is working extensively on developing the controls in this area. I would suggest that you contact Paul directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in general. 3. Funding of inventory We have a structured finance facility here in London. The deal is specific to Enron Metals markets in that it works by reference to LME prices as these are the base index for all the positions placed in the facility. If structured financing is sort for EIM then it would be appropriate to talk to either David Tregar (Metals Commercial) or Bill Appleby (Global Finance) as an intro to the issues faced. 4.

Could these entities be the contracting parties? Raymond it is really a tax call as to which is the most effective contracting structure. I have copies in Susan Musch (our Houston based tax expert).

I'd like to be able to decide if I want to go long, short or flat next hour rather than HOPE for a good Balancing Market clearing price. Options good, take what you get..bad. Sorry Marianne you had to hear it twice. Go ARM!

Their may be a devil in the details, but having a liquid transparent spot market can only help us in a number of different ways: 1. It will give us leverage (or at least information) when negotiating bilateral contracts, 2. It will reduce the prices for ancillary services and load following 3. It will allow us to use scheduling more effectively to control our costs, and 3. It will give us another option in purchasing generation. Enron's fear is that the imbalance and ancillary service market will be shallow and illiquid. I believe that fear is reasonable. A healthy robust spot market can mitigate any damage that a short ancillaries market can do. It will also provide information and induce transparency which does not exist in a market that is solely bilateral. Conceptually, NewEnergy supports Enron in trying to develop a spot market. I would like to hear whether we all can support Enron in this endeavor. VP\n### Response:\n", "output": "benign"}

The ISO intends to issue new solicitations for both programs in the next 1 1/2 weeks. Two additional RFBs for the Demand Relief Program, one for Loads only and one for Loads with back-up generators, are scheduled for issuance early next week with bids due May 1. They will be posted to our website and noticed by email. Based on ISO Governing Board approval on May 10, these Loads will begin participation in the Demand Relief Program on either June 1 or July 1, as feasible. The ISO Governing Board recently approved the design structure of the ISO Discretionary Load Curtailment Program. This program will be operable year-round. The ISO plans to issue the formal RFP in the next 1 1/2 weeks. Proposals will be accepted from aggregators on an ongoing basis. Additional details (subject to some change) can be found in Attachment A of the ISO Management Memo to the Governing Board dated March 7, 2001 and titled, Summer 2001 Preparedness Update and Demand Response Programs.

Give us your opinion on 5 different banner advertisements and enter to win $500! Take the Banner Concepts survey at http://www.rresults.com/bannerconcept/index.cgi _______________________________________________________________ Today's focus: Limitless Linux clustering By Phil Hochmuth Unlimited Scale, a Minnesota-based computer firm, recently announced a new iteration of Linux, which it says can scale Linux clusters into the tens of thousands. Unlimited Linux is the name of the product, and the company has partnered with Compaq to help deliver large-scale Linux clusters on Compaq's line of Alpha-based PC servers and workstations. According to Unlimited Scale, Unlimited Linux product can be used to build and manage large-scale, Linux supercomputing clusters. The software behind Unlimited Linux was built on a morphed version of Linux developed by the Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, which runs one of the largest Linux supercomputer clusters in the world (see \"Don't think 'Lintel,' Part 2: Supercomputing with Linux on the Alpha,\" http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/linux/2000/0605linux1.html) The Sandia Lab cluster - called Cplant - has 2,500 Compaq Alpha nodes in its Linux cluster, which is used to run high-powered mathematical modeling applications, such as the simulation of nuclear or biological war scenarios. Unlimited Linux consists of a standard Linux distribution, which runs on top of a proprietary software layer based on Sandia's Cplant clustering code. The code helps tie together the thousands of nodes in a cluster into a single system image. Specifics on Unlimited Linux availability and pricing will be released next month. _______________________________________________________________ To contact Phil Hochmuth: Phil Hochmuth is a staff writer for Network World, and a former systems integrator.

Take the Banner Concepts survey at http://www.rresults.com/bannerconcept/index.cgi _______________________________________________________________ Today's focus: Limitless Linux clustering By Phil Hochmuth Unlimited Scale, a Minnesota-based computer firm, recently announced a new iteration of Linux, which it says can scale Linux clusters into the tens of thousands. Unlimited Linux is the name of the product, and the company has partnered with Compaq to help deliver large-scale Linux clusters on Compaq's line of Alpha-based PC servers and workstations. According to Unlimited Scale, Unlimited Linux product can be used to build and manage large-scale, Linux supercomputing clusters. The software behind Unlimited Linux was built on a morphed version of Linux developed by the Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, which runs one of the largest Linux supercomputer clusters in the world (see \"Don't think 'Lintel,' Part 2: Supercomputing with Linux on the Alpha,\" http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/linux/2000/0605linux1.html) The Sandia Lab cluster - called Cplant - has 2,500 Compaq Alpha nodes in its Linux cluster, which is used to run high-powered mathematical modeling applications, such as the simulation of nuclear or biological war scenarios. Unlimited Linux consists of a standard Linux distribution, which runs on top of a proprietary software layer based on Sandia's Cplant clustering code. The code helps tie together the thousands of nodes in a cluster into a single system image. Specifics on Unlimited Linux availability and pricing will be released next month. _______________________________________________________________ To contact Phil Hochmuth: Phil Hochmuth is a staff writer for Network World, and a former systems integrator.

{"subject": "EPMI PX Chargeback Complaint", "body": "I talked to Jim Huemiller (with LeBoeuf Lamb) who is Enron's bankruptcy counsel about whether we need to file with FERC a \"Suggestion of Bankruptcy\" rather than simply answer the PX's answer. In a bankruptcy case, there is an automatic stay on actions against the debtor or the debtor's property. Joe questioned whether the stay applies to our complaint at FERC because of Section 362(b) of the Bankruptcy code which excepts from the stay proceedings commenced by governmental units for the exercise of police and regulatory power. According to Jim, the Bankruptcy court may oppose a sanction for violation of the stay. He says there is question of whether Section 362(b) applies to our complaint because we initiated it, not FERC. I said it could be argued whether FERC initiated it under the language of Section 206 of the Federal Power Act. While he agreed there may be legitimate arguments in that regard, he said that the FERC would want to delay issuing an order until after the court allowed it to act because its order could be deemed a nullity if it violated the automatic stay. He also said that if the PX did not (contrary to its promise) file to except the FERC's proceeding from the stay, two things could happen. EPMI could itself file with the bankruptcy court and/or try to get the Court of establish a trustee in the case. * Apparently, there was a conference call with Elizabeth Sager and others where it was decided that we needed to file this \"Suggestion of Bankruptcy.\" * Since the PX's bankruptcy was filed under Section 11 rather than Section 7 of the bankruptcy code, the PX is still a \"debtor in possession\" and a trustee is not appointed unless parties request it and prove that one is warranted pursuant to the bankruptcy code.", "label": "benign", "text": "### Instruction:\nClassify the email as phishing or benign.

These revisions revolve around the concept approved by Andy whereby Enron is willing to allow the Broker to be absolved of responsibility for a \"busted\" deal at such time as the Broker has provided Enron with the verification of the Execution required under the agreement and Enron has yet to obtain an actual confirmation (either in writing or by performance) from the Participant/Counterparty. I have modeled the provisions after the suggestions originally made by Amerex and moved a few of the provisions around in order to accommodate the changes.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life ====================================== Summary of December 30, 2001 ====================================== Dear Folks ? On the last Sunday of 2001, we talked about the matter of time. How fast it passes! What are we to do with it? We are to wait. This class was about what we are waiting for and how we are to wait. The answers are both maddening and embarrassing. There is also an excursion here about how to read the Bible and how Fundamentalism came to be. I hope you find this inspirational and valuable as you reflect on the year just passed and prepare for what is to come. Some famous author once wrote (and I can't find his name now): \"No one ever greeted the first of the year with indifference. I believe that is true. It is a time of new beginnings and of hope. I wish that for you. What follows is the full text from which I spoke on Sunday. Much love, Bill Kerley ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Hurry Up and Wait ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Living life is an art. Our lives and our living are pieces of art to create. Isn't that a great concept? Learning this art is important because we don't have much time to live, do we? This stuff we call \"time\" goes so fast, so very fast. I'm fascinated with time, utterly fascinated. I have surrounded myself with countless devices for measuring the passing of time. For years and years I kept a Day-Timer. I experimented with various sizes and styles. I think I was hoping that if I found the perfect system, I'd be able to accomplish all that I wanted to. Wrong! I've never been able to do that. But, keeping a DayTimer did enable me to see what I do with time and why and what I allow time to do with me and why. I can experience how rapidly it passes and how slowly it drags out. Now for years I've gone paperless and have been using a Palm device. It serves the same function as a DayTimer - just easier to carry. If I go back and look at pages from my DayTimer from several years ago it sometimes seems like I was another person. When I began doing sitting meditation I could experience time as if it were molasses or as a flash of lightening. Sometimes it seems I have been sitting forever and I will open my eyes to see that only a few minutes have passed. At other times, an hour passes in five minutes. Time is so central to us. Think of all the books we read, the instructions we follow, the activities we do just to help us structure time. Early on in life someone gives us a watch and says to us, \"Don't be late again.\" They make an assumption. They assume that we know how to tell time. \"What did you do?\" \"What are you doing?\" \"What are you going to do?\" These are all time questions. When you look at life spiritually, which really is your only option, there is a meaningful answer to all the questions we raise about time. But we find the answer both maddening and embarrassing. Maddening because it turns out that what we are to do with our time is to wait. The word \"wait\" is one of the most characteristic words in the Bible. \"Wait on the Lord.\" \"They that wait upon the Lord shall inherit the earth.\" \"My soul waits for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning.\" According to my count the word \"wait\" is found in the Bible exactly 100 times. If I were to read them all, you would wait a long time. Who wants to spend time like that? What's so maddening about waiting is that we don't know how. We don't like encountering or being confronted with stuff we don't know how to do. In my own life one of the frustrating and disappointing things I've noticed is how I've backslidden in the area of patience.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life ====================================== Summary of December 30, 2001 ====================================== Dear Folks ? On the last Sunday of 2001, we talked about the matter of time. How fast it passes! What are we to do with it? We are to wait. This class was about what we are waiting for and how we are to wait. The answers are both maddening and embarrassing. There is also an excursion here about how to read the Bible and how Fundamentalism came to be. I hope you find this inspirational and valuable as you reflect on the year just passed and prepare for what is to come. Some famous author once wrote (and I can't find his name now): \"No one ever greeted the first of the year with indifference. I believe that is true. It is a time of new beginnings and of hope.
